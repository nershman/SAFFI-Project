The guides on the tins are just that, guides, and if your little one needs more then feed her more. As long as she isn't bringing the extra back up then you know she isn't being overfed.

       "   'body': \"It's quite common knowledge. As well as the sodium levels, there are also issues with the amount or uranium etc in bottled water which can be dangerous for babies.  \\n Babies and young children should not be allowed to drink mineral water, and baby formula feed should not be made up with natural mineral water. Some have high salt or high sulphur content and, in particular, a high uranium content. Uranium is a heavy metal that is toxic to the kidneys and liver. \\n  \\xa0 \\n http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A13745991 \\n Water babies - tap or bottled?  \\n Dentists, health visitors and doctors all recommend that the best 'between meal' dink for children is water and the early introduction will encourage this good habit. But when it comes to water, is bottled your best option or should you opt for tap?  \\n There are three different types of bottled water, Natural Mineral Water (NMW), Spring Water and Table Water.  \\n Natural Mineral Water - This comes from a ground water source which is protected from all pollution and by law cannot be treated in any way. It undergoes two years of stringent analysis before it can be classed as an NMW. It is the purest form of water. However, NMWs contain high levels of minerals, some of which can be dangerous for your toddler. For example, the calcium levels in some mineral waters can be too high for a baby's kidneys to cope with. Similarly, the sodium levels in many NMWs are much higher than the recommended 350mg a day for year old babies. Since December 2003, NMWs suitable for making up formula will be labelled as such.  \\n Spring Water - Comes from a single non-polluted ground water source but unlike NMWs it can undergo some permitted treatments, although it must comply with the Drinking Water Regulations. Unlike NMWs, there is no legislation requiring the mineral content to be printed on the bottle and because of this it's probably best avoided for your baby as there is no way of determining the sodium or mineral content.  \\n Table Water - Is the trade name applied to other bottled drinking waters. It applies to water which may come from more than one source and may include the public water supply. You should treat this water in the same way that you would treat normal tap water if using it to prepare feeds for your baby.  \\n  \\xa0 \\n http://www.babyworld.co.uk/inf [...] /drink.asp \\n Parents who use bottled water to make up baby milk could be poisoning their children. \\n Some brands contain levels of uranium that could harm a developing child, a shock official study has found. \\n They are Buxton - one of the UK's top sellers - Caffe Nero, Radnor Hills, Rocwell, St Yorre and San Pellegrino. \\n Some have four times the amount of uranium considered the safe limit for a baby. \\n Many families have switched from tap water to bottled varieties, believing them to be better and healthier. \\n Sales have doubled in five years to around two billion litres (480million gallons), worth an estimated ¬£1.2billion. \\n But bottled waters pick up minerals from the rock they pass through. These can include uranium, a heavy metal which is particularly toxic to the kidneys. \\n Details of the contamination came from the Government's Committee on Toxicity. \\n It said the Food Standards Agency has estimated that using some natural mineral waters to reconstitute baby formula could mean infants receiving more uranium than the daily limit set by the World Health Organisation. The report says uranium is generally found in \\n water from a granite source. It is weakly radioactive, but radioactivity levels are considered too low to be a health risk. \\n The real concern is the damage uranium can cause to the kidneys. \\n The Department of Health and the National Childbirth Trust already advise mothers to use tap water - boiled and then cooled - to make up bottle feed. \\n Research has consistently shown that breast milk is best for babies, but some women cannot breastfeed, or choose not to, while others combine it with formula milk. The FSA tested 170 samples of bottled water from 15 brands. All met the WHO guideline level for adults, which is 15 micrograms of uranium per litre. \\n But 23 samples from six brands exceeded the recommended limit for babies of 3.2 micrograms. \\n The highest level was in water sold at Caffe Nero coffee shops, although it seems unlikely that mothers would use this to make up baby formula. \\n A spokesman for the firm said its water comes from a guaranteed and respected source in Italy. He insisted it met WHO standards on uranium. \\n The owners of Buxton, Parisbased Nestle Waters, challenged the findings of the study. A spokesman said: 'We are the world leader in bottled water and experts in the field. Buxton is in line with WHO guidelines and European directives in terms of uranium.' \\n The company does not recommend Buxton for baby formula, but this is due to the high mineral and sodium content, not uranium levels. \\n Buxton is the UK's fifth biggest-selling brand, behind Volvic, Vittel, Highland Spring and Evian. Brian Quinn, boss of Northern Ireland-based Rocwell, also challenged accuracy of the FSA research. \\n He said: 'I am surprised by these findings. We test for uranium and it has never shown up as an issue. I can assure you that our water is very suitable to be used for making up baby formula and in baby foods.' \\n Radnor Hills said it does not recommend its water for babies. \\n Experts said the FSA study gives only a snapshot of the uranium in the water at a particular time. Levels could be higher or lower if the same survey was done today. \\n  \\xa0 \\n http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea [...] water.html\",\n",

(sorry if tmi!)  \\n Have you spoken to your HV? \\xa0Was she being sick before you changed her milk? \\n It may be that it's too rich for her little tummy at the moment, it's a curd based milk which means it's made from the creamier, thicker part \\xa0whereas sma gold is a whey based formula so its the opposite (quoted from HV!)  \\n If she's being sick I'd say try to give her some cooled boiled water during the day, just to make sure she's not getting dehydrated. \\n Oh, and I make her milk by boiling the kettle, then putting the boiling water into her bottle to cool by itself, then add the powder. (she's as regular as clockwork so its easy for me this way!) \\xa0if she wants it sooner, I cool the water by running it under the tap, then add the powder.\",\n",

And if it does, maybe just up and up her feed's lots? \\n Also, boiled water (haven't read the debate going on properly) cooled a bit (so obv. it's drinkeable for LO) did world of wonders in keeping my LO's tummy fine, as he'd get constipated and cranky if he didn't have it - just as we would!!  \\n Hope your LO gets better soon, and take care x:hug:\",\n",

She's currently on C&G 1 formula and not sure if to change her as we moved her from SMA gold originally as she had problems digesting that! \\n I would just like to comment on the below: \\n Thw World Health Organisation states the correct way to make bottles and I think that you will find they do suggest bottles should be made using boiled water (that has been left to cool down for 30 mins) to make a bottle. The reason for doing so is that formula powder has been proven to contain bacteria that only boiled water can kill, that is why adding powder to water in bottles that where boiled earlier in the day is not recommended as the water doesnt kill the bacteria in the powder. \\n The WHO say that bottles should be made up for each feed as and when but they do recognise that this may not always be possible or practical therefore bottles may be made in advance but must be made with boiled water (cooled for 30 mins) immediately cooled and kept in the rear of the fridge for no more than 24 hours. Therefore your above comment is incorrect, your are able to warm up a bottle already made.  \\n http://www.who.int/foodsafety/ [...] elines.pdf \\n This is the link to the WHO guidleines preparation of the formula starts on page 13. \\n It does also state that bottled water should be boiled first as it is not sterile. \\n I found the WHO guidlines really helpful and I now make up 3 bottles in advance by way of the recommended guidleines!!!!\",\n",
