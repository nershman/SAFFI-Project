code for properly getting all comments:

import time

start = time.time()
posts = list(get_posts(
    post_urls=["https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1517650235239786&id=144655535872603"],
    cookies="cookies.txt",
    options={"comments":500}

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO INSTALL DIRECTLY FROM GITHUB INSTEAD OF THRU PIP:

virtualenv --python python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install GoogleScraper

Right now (September 2018) this is discouraged. Please install from latest Github sources.
Alternatively install directly from Github

Sometimes the newest and most awesome stuff is not available in the cheeseshop (That's how they call https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip). Therefore you maybe want to install GoogleScraper from the latest source that resides in this Github repository. You can do so like this:

virtualenv --python python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install git+git://github.com/NikolaiT/GoogleScraper/
