Nei paesi d’origine si consuma abitualmente alla conclusione dei pasti poiché aiuta la digestione grazie all’elevata quantità della papaina, un enzima digestivo. La papaya è anche un’ottima fonte di vitamina C e vitamina E, che contrastano l’invecchiamento precoce. E poi è ottima per gli sportivi, perché ha poche calorie e molte fibre.\n",

      "Con l’estate alle porte la frutta diventa sempre di più un alimento indispensabile sulla nostra tavola e sempre piacevole da assaporare: è ricca di sali minerali, di liquidi e di sostanze benefiche per il nostro organismo.

      "L’avocado, un frutto proveniente dall’America Centrale, è un alimento delizioso nutriente e benefico per la salute.

È molto apprezzato per le sue proprietà digestive ed è considerato un vero “brucia grassi” grazie alla bromelina, un enzima che facilita l’assorbimento dei nutrienti nel nostro corpo. E poi grazie a betacarotene e vitamina C permette alla pelle di mantenersi morbida ed elastica\n",
      "Cocco\n",
      "È probabilmente il frutto più semplice da trovare in Italia: costituito dal 50% di acqua e per il resto da fibre, carboidrati, zuccheri e lipidi il cooc possiede un valore nutritivo molto alto e grazie alla ricchezza di vitamine B e C svolge un ruolo rigenerante contrastando la stanchezza. E poi è perfetto dopo un’attività sportiva poiché ricco di potassio che reintegra il giusto equilibrio di sali minerali persi con la sudorazione.\n",
      "Dattero\n",
      "Il dattero è un frutto a forma cilindrica tipico dell’Africa mediterranea e dei paesi dell’Asia occidentale dal grande potere energizzante: possiede un alto contenuto di ferro, vitamine e sali minerali, abbassa i livelli del colesterolo e rappresenta un potente antinfiammatorio naturale. Non a caso nei paesi d’origine è noto anche come l’albero della vita\n",

      "L'attaccante nerazzurro svela: \"\n",
      "Da quando sono all'Inter ho cambiato alimentazione e posso dire che non mi sono mai sentito così forte. La mia dieta? Insalata, pesce, pollo e pasta shirataki. E dopo le gare mangio anche due piatti di gnocchi\"\n",
      "Il segreto sta (anche) a tavola. Dietro lo strapotere fisico mostrato in campo da Romelu Lukaku, c’è anche un’alimentazione ben precisa, un regime alimentare capace di migliorare ed esaltare ancora di più le qualità dell’attaccante belga, trascinatore dell’Inter con 24 reti e sette assist in 33 presenze fino a questo momento della stagione. E se in Inghilterra, come ammesso dallo stesso attaccante in passato, era in sovrappeso, nella sua avventura in nerazzurro il suo fisico è in forma smagliante: \"Da quando sono qui all’Inter abbiamo fatto un'analisi del mio corpo e molto è cambiato: mangio molta insalata, pesce, che ha un ottimo effetto su di me. Mi piace la carnitina, mi fa stare bene, e assumo vitamine\", ha ammesso proprio Lukaku in un podcast con il capo nutrizionista del club nerazzurro Matteo Pincella, pubblicato sui canali ufficiali del club\n",
      "Non mi sono mai sentito così forte\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lukaku svela la sua dieta quotidiana: \"La mia dieta consiste in insalata per pranzo, molto petto di pollo, pasta shirataki. Non cambio molto il mio modo di mangiare, per come giochiamo dobbiamo avere un fisico molto forte, corriamo molto: da quando seguo questo stile di vita mi sento meglio sul campo da gioco, mi sento più reattivo e più veloce\". Il belga ha poi aggiunto: \"Carboidrati? Amo le patate dolci e il riso nero, mentre non mangio molta pasta. Ogni Paese ha il suo modo di alimentarsi: sono sempre stato un giocatore esplosivo, ma l’Italia mi ha portato a un altro livello. Non mi sono mai sentito così forte. Ho raggiunto un altro livello, fisico e mentale\".\n",
      "\n",
      "La dieta pre e post partita\n",
      "\n",
      "Una dieta ben precisa, ma che comunque lascia spazio a qualche \"eccezione\": \"Il giorno prima della partita posso sgarrare con i carboidrati. Reidratarsi è molto importante, così come dormire, soprattutto con il passare degli anni\", ha proseguito Lukaku. \"Come recupero dopo le partite? Assumo carboidrati: la maggior parte delle volte mangio due pacchi di gnocchi, dipende da cosa ha preparato lo chef. Entrano in circolo velocemente, mi aiutano molto. Bevo e mangio già allo stadio, nella nostra sala da pranzo, o mi porto il cibo a casa, poi recupero con tanto ghiaccio. Non dormo molto dopo le partite. Consigli ai giovani? Direi di seguire una dieta corretta, di scoprire e di fare domande su cosa possa farti del bene. Più impari e meglio puoi sentirti\", ha concluso l’attaccante dell’Inter.\n",

      "Tra bici e camminata, la scelta si fa caso per caso\n",
      "\n",
      "Se l'obiettivo è il controllo del peso, le due soluzioni sono entrambe efficaci. Ma molto dipende da chi pratica e dove\n",
      "Meglio andare su due ruote o a piedi? L’Organizzazione mondiale della sanità raccomanda 30 minuti di attività aerobica moderata, quindi sia la bici sia la camminata, per cinque giorni alla settimana (per un totale di 150 minuti), come prevenzione di una lunga lista di patologie\n",
      "E per dimagrire? Il grasso immagazzinato nel corpo viene bruciato se l’attività è aerobica, cioè quando il carburante energetico usato per compierla si forma attraverso reazioni che sfruttano l’ossigeno, fornito ai muscoli dall’apparato cardiovascolare.\n",
      "Nell’esercizio anaerobico, invece, l’energia impiegata proviene dal glicogeno delle cellule muscolari. Per esempio, se si supera la cosiddetta frequenza cardiaca massimale, insomma se ci si affatica, se si ha il fiatone, il consumo è tutto anaerobico.\n",
      "Negli studi sul modo in cui le persone vanno al lavoro, si è visto che sia la bici sia la camminata sono associate a un indice di massa corporea migliore rispetto a chi prende l’auto o un mezzo pubblico.\n",
      "«La bici ha dalla sua che è un modo più veloce di bruciare calorie rispetto alla camminata» spiega Flavio Doni, cardiologo e maratoneta, responsabile a Milano del Marathon Center di Palazzo della Salute-Wellness Clinic (Gruppo San Donato).\n",
      "«Camminare comporta il consumo di una chilocaloria per chilometro e per chilo di peso: dunque, una persona di 70 chili, camminando 5 chilometri, consumerà circa 350 calorie. Invece, per pedalare a una velocità di 20 chilometri orari se ne bruciano più di 500. In teoria, fare delle biciclettate tre volte alla settimana o mettersi sulla cyclette può far perdere peso, con beneficio per gambe, glutei e addominali, equilibrio e postura. La camminata è più facile, ma la bici va privilegiata in caso di problemi alle ginocchia o sovrappeso, perché garantisce carichi minori sulle articolazioni».\n",

      "«L’unico programma proficuo per dimagrire unisce dieta e attività fisica quotidiana o quasi» continua Doni. «Dopo qualche giorno di restrizione calorica l’organismo si organizza nei confronti di quella che interpreta come una “fase di pericolo” e riduce le sue necessità metaboliche: con l’esercizio lo aiutiamo a mantenere alti i suoi consumi.

      "#Cereali a #Colazione, sono sempre #salutari? la percezione che i cereali a colazione siano un toccasana e una scelta sempre salutare e' certamente opinione diffusa. ma e' sempre vero? La rivista tedesca dei consumatori Öko Test ha analizzato 50 marche dei cereali più diffusi a colazione, i cornflakes, ossia i fiocchi di mais. Il test ha indagato la presenza di sostanze potenzialmente pericolose nelle marche più vendute in Germania ma, in alcuni casi, disponibili anche sul mercato italiano.\n",
      "In particolare gli esperti hanno ricercato la presenza di acrilammide, pesticidi, micotossine, idrocarburi, oli minerali (Mosh e Moah) e la quantità di sale e di zucchero.\n",
      "Su 50 campioni analizzati solo 15 hanno ottenuto il massimo dei voti, mentre 14 marche sono risultate “insufficienti” al punto di sconsigliarne il consumo. Tra questi anche nomi di prodotti famosi come Kellogg’s Special K, Nestlé fitness e Nestlé Go Free e vanno male anche i due prodotti Schär testati.\n",
      "Una delle sostanze rinvenute a livelli troppo elevati in ben 18 campioni di cereali è l’acrilammide, un composto riconosciuto come genotossico e cancerogeno, che si forma durante i processi di cottura ad alte temperature (frittura, forno, griglia, tostatura, oltre 120°C), ed è presente in vari alimenti, in particolare quelli che contengono amido e concentrazioni elevate di aminoacidi ( lisina, arginina)\n",

I MOSH(trovati in due confezioni: Vitabella cornflakes e fiocchi di cereali senza glutine Schär), che tendono ad accumularsi nel corpo e sono tossici per il fegato.\n",
      "PESTICIDI Quattro campioni di corn flakes hanno riportato tracce di pesticidi entro i limiti legge. Tra questi i Kellogg’s Special K Classic in cui sono state individuate tracce di glifosato e deltametrina.\n",
      "MICOTOSSINE Quattro prodotti (tutti tipici del mercato tedesco) sono risultati contaminati da micotossine che possono indebolire il sistema immunitario. Si trattava in particolare del deossinivalenolo (DON) e T-2 / HT-2. Questa tossina può essere un problema proprio per i celiaci che assumono grandi quantita' di mais il cereale che più spesso presenta questa tossina.\n",

      "Quali sono i possibili usi dell’acqua ossigenata?\n",
      "Iniziamo quello delle tinture per capelli: nelle miscele di coloranti, il perossido di idrogeno agisce come agente ossidante. Ossida infatti le melanine (composti organici che assorbono la luce visibile e donano il loro colore ai capelli) e questa ossidazione fa trasparire il naturale giallo pallido della cheratina, la proteina che compone i capelli. Nella tintura è presente anche un composto alcalino, ad esempio l'ammoniaca, per aprire le cuticole dei capelli. Il perossido è anche responsabile dell'ossidazione di altre sostanze chimiche nella miscela colorante per produrre i composti chimici che si legano ai capelli.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il perossido di idrogeno non aiuta a decolorare solo i capelli: serve anche a sbiancare la pasta di legno e la carta, ed è anche utilizzato nei prodotti per le pulizie domestiche come alternativa ai composti a base di cloro o negli smacchiatori che si utilizzano prima del lavaggio. Va a cambiare la struttura delle molecole coloranti e quindi il loro assorbimento nel visibile, facendo sparire le macchie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viene utilizzato anche come disinfettante, comunemente disponibile in farmacia come soluzione al 3%, inoltre è usato al 35% in odontoiatria come sbiancante.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il perossido di idrogeno è anche presente negli starlight, separato dagli altri composti fino a quando il bastoncino luminoso non si spezza. Quando ciò accade, si mescola e reagisce con il composto estereo contenuto nell'altro scomparto; uno dei prodotti che questa reazione produce è l'estere perossiacido, un composto instabile che produce energia che eccita le molecole del colorante decomponendosi. Quando la molecola torna ad un livello di energia più basso, rilascia un fotone di luce visibile, provocando il bagliore del bastoncino luminoso.\n",
      "\n",
      "In alte concentrazioni trova impiego anche come propellente per razzi e siluri, sia come comburente per bruciare un opportuno combustibile, sia singolarmente. Quando viene usato da solo, è pompato in una camera di reazione rivestita in argento che ne catalizza la decomposizione; la miscela di ossigeno e vapore acqueo ad alta pressione che si ottiene fornisce la spinta.\n",

      "Lo scopo è mostrare quanta chimica nella nostra vita, spesso senza che ce ne accorgiamo. Oggi parliamo di glicerina (o glicerolo), un composto molto versatile che troviamo sia in campo cosmetico che alimentare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il glicerolo è un composto contenente tre gruppi idrossilici (-OH), e che a temperatura ambiente appare come un liquido viscoso, incolore e inodore, dal sapore dolciastro. La presenza di tre gruppi -OH lo rende miscibile con l'acqua in ogni proporzione.\n",

      "Industrialmente, si ottiene come sottoprodotto della saponificazione, che prevede il trattamento di grassi vegetali o animali con soluzioni alcaline; è anche un sottoprodotto del biodiesel. Il composto ha una vasta gamma di usi nell'industria alimentare. Grazie alla sua dolcezza, (circa il 60% di quella del saccarosio) può essere utilizzato come dolcificante. Inoltre, può agire come un umettante, assorbendo e trattenendo l'umidità e per questo trova impiego come additivo nei prodotti da forno. Viene anche aggiunto alla glassa e ai dolciumi per prevenire la cristallizzazione dello zucchero, ai liquori come agente addensante e può essere usato come solvente per coloranti alimentari (sigla E422).\n",
      "\n",
      "Trova impiego anche in prodotti farmaceutici e cosmetici, come dentifrici, prodotti per la cura della pelle, creme da barba e collutori. Viene spesso aggiunto come agente levigante e anche come umettante per evitare che i prodotti si secchino o come agente di rivestimento delle compresse. Si utilizza come lassativo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trova impiego anche come antigelo in quanto, a causa della presenza di gruppi idrossilici, il glicerolo può formare legami idrogeno con molecole d'acqua: una composizione contenente il 70% di glicerolo ha un punto di congelamento intorno ai -38°C.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il glicerolo viene utilizzato anche come precursore degli esplosivi: è il materiale di partenza nella produzione della nitroglicerina.

      "\n",
      "La maggiore associazione di rappresentanza e assistenza dell’agricoltura italiana si chiama Coldiretti. Codiretti è un insituzione prestigiosa che ultimamente ha pubblicato una lista dove mette in ordine i cibi più rischiosi secondo l’Unione Europea, che sono molto usati anche in Italia. Infatti molti di questi allimenti sono allarmanti per il loro contenuto oltre i limiti di legge di residui chimici, micotossine, metalli pesanti, inquinanti microbiologici, diossine, additivi chimici e coloranti.\n",
      "Coldiretti informa che i Paesi che hanno ottenuto più problemi con questi cibi sono la Turchia (2.925 per prodotti non adatti al consumo), seguita dalla Cina con 256 e dall’India con 194 segnalazioni. Gli Stati Uniti con 176 e la Spagna con 171 segnalazioni sono i paesi con meno segnalazioni di tutti. Questi ed altri paesi ogni anno si trovano davanti ad alimenti che rischiano di danneggiare l’organismo delle persone.\n",
      "Tutti questi fatti sono cose con le quali Italia combatte regolarmente, e perciò è importante informarsi sulla provenienza dei cibi, controllando sempre le etichette prima di comprare e cercando di comprare prodotti con la provenienca certificata e affidabile. Facendo queste piccole cose aiutiamo noi stessi, le nostre famiglie, e denunciando aiutiamo anche le altre persone che non hanno le informazioni che abbiamo noi. Una cosa importante è anche conoscere la qualità di quello che stiamo mangiando.\n",
      "Considerando tutto questo, l’Italia è uno dei paesi con meno segnalazioni della classifica calcolando la presenca dei prodotti cimici fuori dal sicuro (0.5%), anche rispetto alla media dell’Unione Europea che è dell’1,7%. Apparte questo, ci sono e ci saranno sempre dei cibi dai quali di deve fare una particolare attenzione perchè potrebbero essere pericolosi. La maggior parte di noi non sa quali sono questi cibi, e purtroppo fanno parte dei nostri piatti tutti i giorni:\n",

      "\"In Italia per ogni due diabetici noti ce n’è uno che non è noto. Anche per questo sono fondamentali gli esami ad hoc\"\n",
      "“Bisogna dare molta più importanza alla glicemia, ma soprattutto alla glicemia come trigger dei veri problemi che la glicemia produce. Il glucosio di per sé danneggia l’occhio, i reni, il sistema nervoso e in misura minore il cuore. Il diabetico ha anche un rischio di infarto di gran lunga superiore rispetto ai non diabetici”. A dirlo a Gazzetta Active è il dottor Carmine Gazzaruso, responsabile delle Unità Operative di Diabetologia, Endocrinologia, Malattie Metaboliche e Vascolari, nonché del Pronto Soccorso dell’Istituto Clinico Beato Matteo di Vigevano (Pavia) e responsabile dell’Unità di crisi Covid dell’Istituto.\n",
      "Il ruolo della glicemia, e l’importanza di tenerla sotto controllo, vale non solo per chi ha il diabete. Parliamo di tutti e, in particolare, di chi ha il pre-diabete, ovvero lo stadio precedente il diabete. I rischi sono notevoli…\n",
      "“Il diabete è un fattore di rischio per tutti i vasi sanguigni, sia grossi sia piccoli. Provoca complicanze macro e microvascolari. I grossi vasi vanno al cervello (da qui il rischio di ictus), al cuore (rischio di infarto) e agli arti inferiori (rischio di amputazioni). Questo rischio nel diabetico è più alto da due a quattro volte rispetto alla popolazione generale. Il pre-diabete è un fattore di rischio per la patologia cardiaca, cerebrale e degli arti inferiori esattamente uguale al diabete. Parlando in particolare delle donne, in percentuale quelle malate di diabete hanno dieci volte un rischio maggiore rispetto ad una donna non diabetica. Negli uomini diabetici il rischio aumenta di quattro volte rispetto all’uomo non diabetico”.\n",
      "Quindi il consiglio di tenere sotto controllo la glicemia è valido per tutti?\n",

      "\n",
      "La paura della chimica è un pregiudizio che si associa a preconcetti errati che non hanno alcun fondamento né scientifico o tossicologico.\n",
      "Una conseguenza dell’atteggiamento chemofobico a livello di società è stata l’adozione, principalmente a scopo di marketing, da parte di alcune aziende operanti nel settore alimentare dei claim “chemical-free”, o “zero chimica” o “senza sostanze chimiche”. Queste affermazioni sono chiaramente prive di senso da un punto di vista scientifico, ma sono introdotte volutamente per far leva sull’atteggiamento diffuso di chemofobia e vendere di più.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ma siamo sicuri che ciò che è naturale non possa essere nocivo?\n",
      "Anzi, le sostanze più tossiche in assoluto sono proprio di origine naturale, come il veleno di alcuni serpenti, funghi, muffe o meduse. La pericolosità di una sostanza chimica inoltre, non dipende assolutamente dal procedimento utilizzato per sintetizzarla, ma dalle sue caratteristiche intrinseche. Come diceva Paracelso, è la dose che fa il veleno, non certo il modo in cui questa sostanza è stata sintetizzata.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chi ha paura delle sostanze chimiche?\n",
      "Secondo una recente ricerca dell’Institute for Environmental Decisions, in Svizzera, il 39% dei cittadini europei, che vorrebbe addirittura vivere in un mondo in cui non esistono sostanze chimiche. Il sondaggio è stato condotto su larga scala in otto paesi europei (Svizzera, Austria, Francia, Germania, Italia, Polonia, Svezia e Regno Unito) e mostra dati allarmanti. Per contrastare la chemofobia molti chimici e divulgatori si stanno impegnando per la diffusione della corretta comunicazione della chimica. Questa comunicazione rivolta al grande pubblico dovrebbe diventare centrale, non solo per diffondere cultura, ma soprattutto per coinvolgere il pubblico e migliorare così il rapporto tra chimica e società. #chemofobia #chimica #divulgazione @ Milan, Italy Anche la cicuta è un prodotto naturale.

      "I peperoni hanno diversi colori: verdi, gialli, rossi. Ma cosa fa variare il loro colore?\n",
      "I peperoni sono verdi grazie alla clorofilla, che esiste in due forme, a e b. Man mano che il peperone matura, la clorofilla inizia a decomporsi e altri tipi di pigmenti iniziano a prendere il sopravvento. Gli altri colori sono dovuti a molecole dette carotenoidi.\n",
      "I peperoni gialli devono la loro colorazione principalmente alla violaxantina, luteina e beta-carotene.\n",
      "La colorazione rossa, invece, è dovuta alla produzione dei carotenoidi capsantina e capsorubina, che si trovano quasi esclusivamente nei peperoni rossi, poiché la maggior parte delle altre piante non sono in grado di sintetizzare.\n",
      "La sintesi di capsantina e capsorubina richiede un tipo di reazione chimica nota come riarrangiamento pinacolico (o trasposizione pinacolica). Questa reazione di solito richiede un catalizzatore acido concentrato, ma i peperoni possono eseguirla in condizioni quasi neutre e a temperatura ambiente con l'aiuto di enzimi che ancora non sono stati identificati.Abbastanza impressionante, vero?\n",
      "Oltre a cambiare il colore, con la maturazione cambiano anche i composti che ne definiscono l’aroma. Nei peperoni verdi la molecola principale è la 2-metossi-3-isobutilpirazina o \"pirazina di peperone fresco\". Ha una soglia di odore incredibilmente bassa, il che significa che il suo odore può essere rilevato al di sotto del livello di una parte per trilione. Ci sono altri composti volatili nel peperone verde, che diminuiscono man mano che si va verso maturazione.\n",
      "Invece, concentrazioni sia di (E) -2-esenale che di (E) -2-esenolo, associate ad aromi dolci e fruttati, sono maggiori nei peperoni rossi, a spiegare la sottile differenza tra gli aromi dei peperoni di diversi colori.\n",

      "In fact, in cases of poisoning with Amanita mushrooms, which destroy the liver, milk thistle is the only treatment option. It has been so dramatically effective that the treatment has never been disputed, even by the traditional medical community.This species is an annual or biennial plant of the Asteraceae family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk thistle acts in a similar fashion to detoxify other synthetic chemicals that find their way into our bodies, from acetaminophen and alcohol to heavy metals and radiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milk thistle was approved in 1986 as a treatment for liver disease and it is widely used to treat alcoholic hepatitis, alcoholic fatty liver, cirrhosis, liver poisoning and viral hepatitis. It has also been shown to protect the liver against medications such as acetaminophen, a non-aspirin pain reliever.\n",
      "\n",
      "The active ingredient, or liver-protecting compound in milk thistle is known as silymarin. This substance, which actually consists of a group of compounds called flavonolignans, helps repair liver cells damaged by alcohol and other toxic substances by stimulating protein synthesis. By changing the outside layer of liver cells, it also prevents certain toxins from getting inside. Silymarin also seems to encourage liver cell growth. It can reduce inflammation (important for people with liver inflammation or hepatitis), and has potent antioxidant effects. Antioxidants are thought to protect body cells from damage caused by a chemical process called oxidation. Our Milk Thistle is not standardized to an exact amount (as it is made from pure dried natural herbs. Milk Thistle naturally contains about 70 - 80% Silymarin (and many other constituents thought to work in harmony).\n",

      "A comprehensive review by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) recently identified 16 scientific studies on the use of milk thistle for the treatment of various forms of liver disease. A European standardized extract of milk thistle was used in most of the trials. Problems in study design (such as small numbers of participants, variations in the causes of liver disease, and differences in dosing and duration of milk thistle therapy) made it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions. However, five of seven studies evaluating milk thistle for alcoholic liver disease found significant improvements in liver function. Those with the mildest form of the disease appeared to improve the most. Milk thistle was less effective for those with severe liver disease such as cirrhosis. Cirrhosis is characterized by scarring and permanent, non-reversible damage to the liver. It is often referred to as end-stage liver disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "Viral hepatitis\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the fact that milk thistle is widely used in the treatment of hepatitis (particularly hepatitis C), results from four viral hepatitis studies were contradictory. Some found improvements in liver enzyme activity while others failed to detect these benefits. None of the studies compared milk thistle with interferon or other medications for viral hepatitis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cancer\n",
      "\n",
      "Preliminary laboratory studies also suggest that active substances in milk thistle may have anti-cancer effects. One active substance known as silymarin has strong antioxidant properties and has been shown to inhibit the growth of human prostate, breast, and cervical cancer cells in test tubes. Further studies are needed to determine whether milk thistle is safe or effective for people with these forms of cancer.\n",

      "The ant tree is so called because all the cavities in its trunk and branches are populated by ants. The curative properties of this tree are well known to the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Peru who call it the divine tree. Its bark is a natural antibiotic that has long been used in traditional medicine to treat a variety of infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pau D’Arco natural product is made from the internal layer of ant tree bark. It kills bacteria and viruses and also has an anti-inflammatory effect. In addition, it increases immunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lapahol is the main ingredient of the bark that has an antibacterial effect. It is found on the inside of the bark and prevents the growth and reproduction of gram-positive and gram-negative microbodies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lapahol can also slow down the production of enzymes which explains its antiviral effect since viruses can’t multiply without enzymes. Ant tree bark can destroy the viruses of flu, herpes, corona viruse,s and a number of others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its antifungal properties stem from xyloidine, which when combined with lapahol, suppresses the growth of many types of fungi, including vaginal fungi (candida, trihofiton). Even the wood itself is extremely resistant to fungi which never grow on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The anti-parasite effect manifests in its ability to inhibit the reproduction and growth of intracellular parasites. It also prevents invasions of micro pathogens by creating a most adverse environment for adaptable parasites. This is why ant tree is routinely included in herbal anti-parasite programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it also improves immunity, this unique tree can be used to combat allergies and autoimmune conditions in the body without the fear that they may get worse as a result. The bark increases the non-specific resistance of the body, boosting the cellular and humoral immunity. But, the most important thing is that all of the properties of the ant tree bark listed above have been thoroughly researched and confirmed. It has also been proven that none of the ingredients found in the bark can have the same effect on their own.\n",

      "Shocking Heart Health and Dementia Connection\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of us think of poor cardiovascular health as causing strokes and heart attacks, which is terrifying enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a study that has just been published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology reveals a connection between poor heart health and dementia.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s a condition that most of us dread more than anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2008, the journal Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association, published a study that summarized the main risk factors for serious cardiovascular events, like heart attacks, strokes, coronary heart disease, and heart failure. The authors derived these risk factors from the Framingham Heart Study, a huge study that ran for decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "People who score highly on these risk factors do not necessarily have cardiovascular disease yet, but participants in the Framingham Heart Study who scored highly for these factors were much more likely than their peers were to suffer a cardiovascular event in the following 10 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "The risk factors are age, sex, smoking status, total cholesterol, HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, hypertension medication, and diabetes status.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors of the new study wondered whether people with many of these cardiovascular risk factors were more likely than those without them to develop dementia in the following two decades, and decided to find out.\n",
      "\n",
      "They collected the medical data of 1,588 people who had participated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. At the beginning of the study, they had an average age of 79 and were all dementia-free.\n",
      "\n",
      "They were followed for up to 21 years and each participant was given a battery of 19 cognitive tests every year to test abilities like episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, visuospatial ability, and perceptual speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on the brains of a subsample of subjects to obtain their brain volumes and structures.\n",
      "\n",
      "After approximately two decades, it turned out that people with the highest risk scores were significantly more likely to suffer a decline in episodic and working memory and perceptual speed. Their scores on general cognitive tests that incorporated many different abilities were also lower than those whose risk factors scores were closer to normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those with high cardiovascular risk scores tended to have a smaller hippocampus, less gray matter, smaller brains, and more damage to their white matter, which explained why their cognitive abilities deteriorated faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is, of course, normal for cognitive abilities to decline with old age, but they deteriorated faster for those people with high cardiovascular risk scores. In fact, in this study, faster deterioration could already be seen after less than six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was true for both people with and without a genetic predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors recommended that people started tackling these cardiovascular risk factors aggressively during their middle age to prevent them from ruining a long and peaceful retirement.\n",

      "HOW TO DIAGNOSE COMMON THYROID SYMPTOMS AND TREAT THYROID DISEASE\n",
      "Thyroid disease has become very prevalent in today's world, courtesy of a number of different lifestyle factors. An estimated 1 in 8 women aged 35 to 65 has some form of thyroid disease — underactive thyroid being the most common.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than one-quarter of women in perimenopause are diagnosed with hypothyroidism, in which insufficient amounts of thyroid hormones are produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thyroid hormones2 are used by every cell of your body, which is why the symptoms can vary so widely. For example, thyroid hormones regulate metabolism and body weight by controlling the burning of fat for energy and heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thyroid hormones are also required for growth and development in children. They signal the production of virtually all growth factors in your body, including:\n",
      "-Somatomedins (skeletal tissue growth)\n",
      "-Erythropoietin (involved in the development of red blood cells)\n",
      "-Nerve growth factor\n",
      "-Epidermal growth factor\n",
      "\n",
      "In pregnant women, thyroid hormone is also involved in the production of prolactin, a hormone responsible for milk production.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor thyroid function has been linked to a wide array of serious health conditions, from fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome, to infertility, autoimmune diseases, and thyroid cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why it's so important to understand how your thyroid works and what can cause it to dysfunction.\n",
      "\n",
      "UNDERSTANDING HOW YOUR THYROID GLAND WORKS\n",
      "The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland found inside your neck, right under your larynx or voice box. A two-inch long, highly vascular gland, it has two lobes located on each side of the windpipe, connected by a tissue called the isthmus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your thyroid is responsible for producing the master metabolism hormones that affect virtually every function in your body. It produces three types of hormones:\n",
      "-Triiodothyronine (T3)\n",
      "-Thyroxine (T4)\n",
      "-Diiodothyronine (T2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Hormones secreted by your thyroid interact with all your other hormones, including insulin, cortisol, and sex hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fact that these hormones are all tied together and are in constant communication explains why a less-than-optimal thyroid status is associated with so many widespread symptoms and diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Almost 90 percent of the hormone produced by your thyroid is in the form of T4, the inactive form. Your liver then converts the T4 into T3, the active form, with the help of an enzyme.\n",
      "T2 is currently the least-understood component of thyroid function and the subject of a number of ongoing studies.\n",
      "If everything is working properly, you will make what you need and have the correct amounts of T3 and T4, which control the metabolism of every cell in your body.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your T3 is inadequate, either by scarce production or not converting properly from T4, your entire body will experience the consequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "THYROID DISRUPTORS ABOUND…\n",
      "It's important to realize that thyroid dysfunction is a complex issue with many variables and many potential underlying causes, including the following (NOTE: if your thyroid dysfunction is caused by factors such as these, detoxification and changing your lifestyle to avoid hormone disrupting chemicals may be key components of successful intervention):\n",
      "\n",
      "Estrogen dominance: Midlife hypothyroidism can be related to underlying estrogen dominance, in which case taking thyroid hormone fails to address the root of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medications: Certain medications, such as steroids, barbiturates, cholesterol–lowering drugs, and beta blockers can disrupt your thyroid function, in which case the most appropriate remedy may not be to add thyroid hormone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Endocrine-disrupting chemicals like mercury, lead, phthalates, and bisphenol-A (BPA) have been linked to both early menopause and thyroid problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bromine exposure: Bromines found in pesticides, plastics, bakery goods, beverages containing brominated vegetable oils (BVOs), and flame retardants also have a disruptive effect on thyroid function. Bromine, chlorine, and fluoride are all in the same family as iodine, and all three can therefore displace iodine in your thyroid gland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heavy metals: Heavy metal toxicity is yet another factor that can be part of the problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fluoride: Fluoride, which is still routinely added to water supplies in many areas across the US, was used in Europe to reduce thyroid activity in hyperthyroid patients as late as the 1970s. According to a 2006 report by the American National Research Council of the National Academies, fluoride is \"an endocrine disruptor in the broad sense of altering normal endocrine function.\" This altered function can involve your thyroid, parathyroid, and pineal glands, as well as your adrenals, pancreas, and pituitary. Altered thyroid function is associated with fluoride intakes as low as 0.05 to 0.1 mg fluoride per kilogram body weight per day (mg/kg/day), or 0.03 mg/kg/day with iodine deficiency. Fluoride has the ability to:\n",
      "-Mimic thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\n",
      "-Damage the cells of your thyroid gland\n",
      "-Disrupt conversion from the inactive form of the thyroid hormone (T4) to the active form (T3)\n",
      "\n",
      "SYMPTOMS OF UNDERACTIVE THYROID\n",
      "Symptoms of hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) may include but are not limited to the following:\n",
      "-Fatigue, loss of energy, and general lethargy\n",
      "-Cold intolerance\n",
      "-Muscle and/or joint pain\n",
      "-Decreased sweating\n",

      "STANDARD THYROID TEST MISDIAGNOSES MANY\n",
      "The most common way to diagnose thyroid dysfunction is by measuring how much thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) your pituitary gland excretes. When your thyroid is not producing sufficient levels of thyroid hormone, your pituitary sends out TSH to encourage the thyroid to increase production.\n",
      "Hence the higher your TSH level is, the more likely you are to have hypothyroidism. However, while the TSH test has become the gold standard for determining the activity level of your thyroid, this test may not be entirely adequate.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dr. Raphael Kellman, an integrative medicine practitioner in New York City who specializes in thyroid disorders, many patients whose TSH level falls within the accepted \"normal\" range still exhibit classic symptoms of low thyroid. As noted in a recent Epoch Times article, the TSH test \"frequently misrepresents what is happening in the thyroid and the pituitary.\"\n",
      "Part of the problem is that the TSH test fails to reveal the influence of endocrine disrupting chemicals, which can wreak absolute havoc on your hormone function.\n",
      "\n",
      "As noted in the featured article:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"In order to detect a thyroid problem, a TSH test must assume that hormonal signaling in the rest of the system is functioning normally. Because endocrine disrupting chemicals may disrupt many points along the signaling system and not just the thyroid, it can be difficult to identify an imbalance with a TSH test alone. Kellman says this is a big reason why the conventional blood tests and reference ranges used to detect a thyroid abnormality can overlook real problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "'We have to realize that when it comes to endocrine disruptors the blood test can be elusive. It doesn't show up as definitively as when you see the effects of the autoimmune process,' he said. 'It may not be as evident on blood testing. And blood tests can even look contradictory.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "THE CASE FOR TRH AND REVERSE T3 TESTING\n",
      "In cases where TSH is within normal range yet symptoms of low thyroid are still present, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) stimulation test may offer additional clues. It involves getting an injection of thyrotropin (which is produced by your hypothalamus gland), in response to which your pituitary gland dumps all of its stored TSH into your bloodstream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The TRH test basically tells you how much TSH your pituitary contains, in total, opposed to how much TSH it is sending out in any given moment. Having plenty of TSH stored in your pituitary yet showing normal levels on the TSH test is suggestive of a dysfunction in your pituitary gland, and underlying toxicity may be part of the problem. As noted by Dr. Kellman:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Toxins don't have to reach high levels in order to affect a delicate system that's very, very vulnerable to toxicity. Especially the thyroid which is the most vulnerable component of the endocrine system.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Jonathan Wright, pioneer in natural medicine, has also noted that elevated reverse T310 (RT3) levels tend to signal the presence of toxic metals. In his experience, most people who have elevated RT3 levels will see their levels revert back to normal after undergoing chelation with EDTA and DMPS, which draw out cadmium, lead, mercury, and other toxic metals. In essence, heavy metal toxicity can cause a functional form of hypothyroidism. As previously explained by Dr. Wright:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's very well-known that lead and cadmium interfere with testosterone production. What's not so well-known is that reverse T3 is stimulated by toxic metals, so up it goes. In effect, we can have levels that are so high, they way outnumber the regular T3. You're functionally hypothyroid even if your TSHs and free T3s happen to be normal.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "LAB TESTS TO ASSESS THYROID FUNCTION\n",
      "To get a fuller picture of your thyroid health, it is recommended to use the following laboratory tests:\n",
      "\n",
      "TSH Test: The higher your level of TSH, the higher the likelihood that you have hypothyroidism. The ideal level for TSH is between 1 and 1.5 milli-international units per liter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Free T4 and Free T3: The normal level of free T4 is between 0.9 and 1.8 nanograms per deciliter. T3 should be between 240 and 450 picograms per deciliter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thyroid Antibody Testing: This includes thyroid peroxidase antibodies and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. These two measures help determine if your body is attacking your thyroid or overreacting to its own tissues (i.e., autoimmune reactions). Unfortunately, conventional physicians nearly always leave this test out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Basal Body Temperature: Although there are a few different protocols, the most commonly used is the Broda Barnes system, which is a measure of your basal body temperature at rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "TRH Stimulation Test: For more difficult cases, TRH can be measured using the TRH stimulation test. TRH helps identify hypothyroidism that's caused by inadequacy of the pituitary gland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reverse T3: While reverse T3 (RT3) is metabolically inactive, elevated levels may indicate that heavy metal toxicity is affecting your thyroid function.\n",
      "\n",
      "IODINE IS ESSENTIAL FOR THYROID HEALTH\n",
      "Iodine is the key to a healthy thyroid and efficient metabolism. Even the names of the different forms of thyroid hormone reflect the number of iodine molecules attached – T4 has four attached iodine molecules, and T3 (the biologically active form of the hormone) has three – showing what an important part iodine plays in thyroid biochemistry. As your body cannot produce its own iodine, it must be obtained from your diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, iodine deficiency is extremely common these days. Many people and especially women of child-bearing age, have urine iodine levels less than 50 micrograms per liter (mcg/L), indicating moderate to severe iodine deficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides dietary deficiencies, toxins can also affect your iodine levels by displacing iodine. Iodine is a member of a class of related elements called \"halogens,\" which includes bromine, fluorine, and chlorine. When they are chemically reduced, they become \"halides\" (iodide, bromide, fluoride, and chloride). Most people today are exposed to these halogens/halides via food, water, medications, and environments, and these elements selectively occupy your iodine receptors, further deepening your iodine deficit.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW MUCH IODINE DO YOU NEED FOR THYROID HEALTH?\n",
      "In Japan, the daily dose of iodine obtained from the diet averages around 2,000 to 3,000 micrograms (mcg) or 2 to 3 milligrams (mg). Some argue for even higher amounts than that, such as Dr. David Brownstein, a physician and author of the book \"Iodine: Why You Need It. Why You Can't Live Without It\", who recommends 12.5 milligrams (mg) on a regular basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be prudent for most to avoid taking high doses unless you're using it therapeutically, for a short period of time. There are potentially serious risks to taking too much iodine, which is why it is not generally advised to take large doses of iodine supplements like Lugol's or Iodora long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "Getting iodine from natural sources is best, but if you do choose supplements, supplementation at a dose of a few mg, might be best for most. Iodine is particularly important for pregnant women, as it plays an important role in your baby's brain and nervous system development. Research suggests having sufficient amounts of iodine during the first months of pregnancy can improve your child's IQ by nearly 1.25 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good natural sources of iodine include:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Sea vegetables such as kelp and algae\n",
      "\n",
      "-Seafood such as shrimp, sardines, Alaskan salmon\n",
      "\n",
      "-Seaweed called bladderwrack (Latin name: Fucus vesiculosus), which you can also buy in either powdered form or in capsules\n",
      "\n",
      "RECOMMENDED TYPES OF THYROID MEDICATIONS\n",
      "When it comes to thyroid hormone replacement, you have two basic options:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Bioidentical thyroid hormones include Nature-Throid and Westhroid. They're made from desiccated animal thyroid glands (often from pigs and therefore not HALAL) and contain the full spectrum of thyroid hormones: T4, T3, T2, and T1.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Synthetic hormones, such as Synthroid (generic brand: Levothyroxine), which contains only T4.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the trickiest parts of thyroid hormone replacement is finding the ideal dose. This typically requires fine-tuning over an extended period of time, with regular blood testing to see how the dose is affecting your thyroid hormone levels, and keeping track of your symptoms. Two key signals that you're taking too much hormone are excessive sweating and rapid heartbeat or heart palpitations. If you get either of those symptoms, you're getting too much thyroid, and you need to cut back on the dose.\n",
      "It's also worth noting that in some cases, if you're borderline hypothyroid, you may only need an iodine supplement rather than an actual thyroid hormone replacement. Still, even with thyroid medication, some people still don't see a major improvement in their symptoms, and there may be a number of reasons for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY IS YOUR THYROID MEDICATION NOT WORKING?\n",
      "GreenMedInfo recently addressed this issue, listing several potential reasons why your thyroid medication isn't providing the relief you expected. This includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Undiagnosed Hashimoto's disease — an autoimmune disorder in which your body is attacking your thyroid. As a general rule, signs of Hashimoto's include TSH above 4.25 and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO) above 30.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Reduced thyroid receptor sensitivity, typically due to chronic inflammation. Once your thyroid receptor sensitivity is dulled, the amount of thyroid hormone required in order for your body to recognize and use it increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Poor thyroid hormone conversion. Your body converts inactive T4 to the active T3 form, and a number of factors can impair your body's ability to perform this conversion (including certain nutrient deficiencies, listed below). If your conversion rate is impaired, you're dosage requirement goes up.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Elevated reversed T3 (RT3) levels. High RT3 is not a sign of thyroid deficiency. It is a sign of high stress and/or potential heavy metal toxicity though, indicating you may need to address these two issues in order to return your thyroid to good health.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Iodine, selenium, iron, and/or cortisol deficiency.17Without sufficient amounts of these nutrients, thyroid hormone metabolism and conversion cannot occur. (Selenium deficiency is particularly common in those with gastrointestinal disorders.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Gluten sensitivity. Gluten looks very similar to thyroid hormone, which is why those with Hashimoto's disease are typically required to go on a gluten-free diet to quell the autoimmune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some synthetic thyroid medications can contain gluten, so it's important to make sure your medication is gluten-free, in addition to cutting gluten out of your diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "TREATING OVERACTIVE THYROID (HYPERTHYROIDISM)\n",
      "When your body is producing too much thyroid hormone, you end up with a condition called hyperthyroidism. While overactive thyroid is far less common than underactive, it can be a very serious condition. Making matters worse, conventional treatment options usually involve using radioactive iodine, which is a disaster, or surgery. According to Dr. Jonathan Wright, there may be a much better and safer option: a combination of iodine and lithium.\n",
      "\n",
      "This treatment originated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC), at their department of thyroid. More than two decades ago, The Mayo Clinic also published a paper in which lithium alone brought abnormally high T3 and T4 numbers down to normal within a week to 10 days. It didn't work on everybody though. According to Dr. Wright, Walter Reed's system is profoundly effective, having failed in only two out of about 40 cases that he's treated. Normal T3 and T4 levels can often be achieved in less than two weeks. For more insight into this protocol, please see the video above. In summary, the treatment is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Patient starts out on five drops of Lugol's iodine, three times per day\n",
      "- After four or five days, patient starts receiving 300 mg of lithium carbonate, one to three times per day\n",
      "\n",
      "PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER...\n",
      "Entire books can and indeed have been written on the ins and outs of thyroid health and dysfunction. At best, this article is a summary review of the most common factors to consider. For starters, it is recommended to get a comprehensive thyroid panel done (TSH, T3, T4, and thyroid antibodies) to rule out an autoimmune problem (Hashimoto's disease).\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have Hashimoto's, your treatment will need to include strategies that apply to most autoimmune diseases, including optimizing your vitamin D and gut health, and addressing sources of inflammation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In more complex cases where symptoms are present despite \"normal\" TSH levels, looking at the TRH stimulation test and reverse T3 (RT3) may offer additional clues, including indications of underlying toxicity. If this is the case, then a detoxification protocol needs to be part of your treatment.\n",

      "Next, assess any potential nutrient deficiencies, such as iodine, selenium, calcium, and iron. Also consider exposure to chemicals that displace iodine, such as bromide, fluoride, and chlorine. Unfiltered tap water and processed foods are prime culprits for these three chemicals.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is important, because it may not be enough to simply add more iodine; you may also need to cut out these iodine-replacing chemicals. One 2005 Russian study found that even an increased intake of iodine was insufficient to counter the adverse effects of excessive fluoride exposure on the thyroid gland in children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last but not least, if your thyroid is in fact underactive, you would need to take thyroid hormone. It is recommended using bioidentical thyroid hormones (but, once again, you may need to be careful as they are often derived from pigs and, therefore, not HALAL). Also, in some cases of Hashimoto's, using a synthetic T4 hormone may be advisable, at least in the beginning of your treatment. At that point, tracking your symptoms and testing your thyroid hormone levels at regular intervals is usually necessary to find the correct dosage. Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) is far less common a problem, but if you are one of those unlucky few, it is recommended to review Dr. Wright's regimen.\n",

      "🌿🌿 Seed Cycling for Hormone Balance 🌿🌿\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿 Hormone imbalances can create a whole heap of issues. An imbalance of the hormones estrogen and progesterone may cause estrogen dominance and low levels of progesterone. As many studies suggest, this can increase the risk of certain health conditions such as breast cancer, heart disease and thyroid problems. Seed Cycling is a safe and easy way to help the production, metabolism and regulation of hormones. But first lets have a look at the hormones in conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿 Estrogen and Progesterone have their equal benefits in the body. Progesterone helps regulate the endometrium lining of the uterus, and prepares the body for pregnancy. Estrogen on the other hand, is not only the main female sex organ, but it also regulates cholesterol production in the liver, maintains body temperature, preserves bone strength and prevents bone loss (hence why women after the menopause are at higher risk of bone injuries and fractures due to the lack of estrogen).\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿 What causes estrogen dominance?\n",
      "There are various factors that can cause estrogen dominance:\n",
      "\n",
      "- increased body fat\n",
      "- type 2 diabetes\n",
      "- hyper/hypoglycaemia\n",
      "- under or over active thyroid\n",
      "- poor diet and nutrition\n",
      "- pollutants and toxins\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿What does estrogen dominance do to the body?\n",
      "Estrogen dominance can cause many symptoms such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "- PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome)\n",
      "- PMS (progesterone helps ease this)\n",
      "- weight gain\n",
      "- irregular periods\n",
      "- heavy bleeding\n",
      "- affects sleep and cause fatigue\n",
      "- hair loss\n",
      "- acne\n",
      "- bloating\n",
      "- low sex drive\n",
      "- uterine fibroids\n",
      "- breast lumps and breast tenderness\n",
      "- promote tumour growth\n",
      "\n",
      "In Males it can cause:\n",
      "\n",
      "- infertility\n",
      "- erectile dysfunction\n",
      "- enlarge breasts\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿What is Seed Cycling and how does it work?\n",
      "Seeds are rich in essential fatty acids, zinc and selenium, which are needed for creating healthy hormones. Rotating seeds throughout a typical menstrual cycle may help balance out hormones.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿Days 1 – 14\n",
      "Assuming this is based on a 28 day cycle. Days 1-14 are in the Follicular Phase. This is when estrogen is high. During these days it is advised to take 1-2 tablespoons of Ground Flaxseeds and Pumpkins Seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿Flaxseeds are beneficial in preventing osteoporosis, heart disease and improve estrogen-progesterone ratios. Pumpkin seeds may help prevent breast cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿Days 15 – 28\n",
      "Days 15-28 fall in the Luteal Phase (fertile phase). This is when progesterone goes up and peaks. During these days it is advised to take 1-2 tablespoons of Ground Sesame Seeds and Sunflower Seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌿Sesame seeds are shown to be beneficial in lowering cholesterol, reducing blood pressure and balancing hormones. They are high in fiber which helps metabolise healthy estrogen. They also help reduce inflammation. Sunflower Seeds contain B-complex vitamins, necessary for a healthy nervous system. They are rich in protein and vitamin E, and can help lower cholesterol, blood sugars, blood pressure and support thyroid function.\n",

Preferably, you would want to avoid them in whole. This is a fact and does effect anyone who chooses to consume in such foods.\n",
      "In July of 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration released the results of its latest research on the acrylamide content of common foods.\n",

      "Acrylamide has been shown to cause cancer in animals. Exposure to large doses of acrylamide has also been shown to cause neurological damage in humans.\n",
      "Acrylamide tends to form when foods that are high in carbohydrates and/or an amino acid called asparagine are cooked at high temperatures. Cooking methods that tend to require high temperatures - like frying, roasting, and baking - are more likely to cause acrylamide formation in food. Non-cooked and boiled foods almost never contain detectable levels of acrylamide.\n",
      "The top two food groups listed above - French fries and potato chips - are two of the most damaging foods to human health. Despite the creation of \"healthy\" varieties of French fries and potato chips like New York Fries - Fried in 100% Non-Hydrogenated Sunflower Oil and Trader Joe's Veggie Chips Potato Snacks, it's important to know that all French fries and potato chips that have been deep-fried in oil are heavily laced with acrylamide and pose a significant threat to one's health.\n",

      "\n",
      "Je suis ici pour vous parler de la PROSTATE. Le sujet prête un peu à confusion. La PROSTATE est-elle strictement réservée aux hommes? Oui, seuls les hommes ont la PROSTATE.\n",
      "les hommes de plus de 40 ans sont plus exposés . Il n'y a pas de femme qui ne connait pas un homme de 40 ans et plus : père, oncle, frère, fils, ami, voisin, collègue ...\n",
      "Ce que je vais faire aujourd'hui, c'est la promotion de la santé responsable sur trois points :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Informations\n",
      "2. assurance\n",
      "3. Un plan d'action.\n",
      "\n",
      "Permettez-moi de commencer par un aperçu de la santé de la prostate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tout le monde a une paire de reins. Le travail du rein est d'enlever les déchets (société de gestion des déchets) de votre corps. Chaque jour, votre sang traverse plusieurs fois le rein pour être filtré. Lorsque le sang est filtré, l'urine est formée et stockée dans un réservoir de stockage temporaire appelé vessie.\n",
      "\n",
      "S'il n'y avait pas de vessie, l’homme marcherait sur la route, en Voyant couler son urine de façon continue.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintenant, pensez au travail de plomberie dans votre maison. Pensez à la vessie comme réservoir de stockage aérien. À partir du réservoir de stockage, un bon plombier acheminera les tuyaux vers d'autres parties de la maison, y compris la cuisine. Dieu dans sa sagesse a fait passer des tuyaux de notre vessie à l'extrémité du pénis. Le tuyau est appelé l'urètre. Juste en dessous de la vessie et entourant un petit organe appelé la PROSTATE.\n",
      "\n",
      "La PROSTATE est de la taille d'une noix et pèse environ 20 grammes. Son travail consiste à fabriquer le liquide séminal qui est stocké dans la vésicule séminale. Pendant les rapports sexuels, le liquide séminal descend dans l'urètre et se mélange aux spermatozoïdes produits dans les testicules pour former le sperme. Donc, le sperme n'est pas techniquement du sperme. C'est sperme + liquide séminal. Le liquide séminal lubrifie le sperme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Après 40 ans, pour des raisons hormonales, la glande PROSTATIQUE commence à grossir. De 20 grammes, il peut atteindre presque 100 grammes. Au fur et à mesure qu'il grossit, il serre l'urètre et l'homme commence à remarquer des changements dans la façon d’ uriner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Si vous avez un fils de moins de 10 ans, s'il a un petit méfait comme nous l'avons tous fait à cet âge, quand il sort pour uriner, il peut cibler le plafond et le jet atteindra la cible. Appelez son père pour faire de même,. Son jet d'urine est faible, ne peut pas parcourir une longue distance et peut parfois venir directement sur ses jambes. Donc, il peut avoir besoin de se mettre dans une position inconfortable pour uriner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peu d'hommes s'inquiètent que leur jet d'urine ne puisse atteindre le plafond. Les toilettes sont sur le sol et non sur le plafond. Mais d'autres symptômes commencent à apparaître.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸 DERNIER DEGOULINEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "L'homme commence à remarquer qu'après avoir uriné et réemballé, l'urine tombe encore sur son pantalon. C'est la raison pour laquelle, après qu'un homme plus âgé ait uriné, il doit sonner la cloche. Un jeune homme livre simplement à la dernière goutte et s'éloigne. Juste voir un homme plus âgé venant de la salle de bain. Parfois, il peut serrer le journal de près pour cacher les taches d'urine, en particulier sur les pantalons de couleur unie.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸HÉSISTATION\n",
      "\n",
      "À ce stade, vous attendez plus longtemps pour que le flux d'urine commence. Il y a 2 valves qui doivent s'ouvrir pour que vous uriniez- les sphincters internes et externes. Les deux s'ouvrent mais à cause des obstructions dans l'urètre, vous attendez plus longtemps pour que le flux commence.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸VIDAGE INCOMPLET\n",
      "\n",
      "Juste après avoir uriné Vous avez ce sentiment qu'il reste encore quelque chose.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comme toutes ces choses se produisent, la vessie commence à travailler plus fort pour compenser l'obstruction dans l'urètre. La fréquence de la miction augmente. L'urgence s'installe. Parfois, vous devez pratiquement courir dans les toilettes. La nycturie devient également commune. Vous vous réveillez plus de 2 fois la nuit pour uriner. Votre femme commence à se plaindre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les hommes étant des hommes, peuvent ne parler à personne même à ce stade. Ensuite, les complications les plus graves commencent.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'urine stockée est infectée et il peut y avoir une sensation de brûlure en urinant.\n",
      "\n",
      "L'urine stockée forme des cristaux. Les cristaux se réunissent pour former de la pierre dans la vessie ou dans le rein ( CALCULS RÉNAUX ). Les pierres peuvent bloquer l'urètre.\n",
      "\n",
      "La rétention urinaire chronique s'installe. La vessie stocke de plus en plus d'urine. La taille de la vessie est de 40 à 60cl. Une bouteille de coca est 50cl. Comme la vessie stocke plus d'urine, elle peut grossir jusqu'à 300 cl. Une vessie trop remplie peut fuir et entraîner une incontinence urinaire / mouillante. De plus, le volume peut exercer une pression sur le rein et entraîner des lésions rénales.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ce qui peut probablement amener l'homme à l'hôpital est la rétention urinaire aiguë. Il se réveille un jour et il ne peut pas uriner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tout ce que j'ai décrit ci-dessus est associé à l'élargissement de la PROSTATE, techniquement appelé HYPERPLASIES BÉNIGNE DE LA PROSTATE.\n",

      "Conference Mondiale #Agroforestry2019 : Make our Planet treed again !\n",
      "\n",
      "Si vous avez rate la Conference Mondiale sur l’agroforesterie, voici quelques notes personnelles sur ce qu'elle nous a revele. L’agroforesterie est un monde étonnant et multiforme. Un kaléidoscope, habité de milliers de fourmis, nous les agroforestiers, qui étudions chacun quelques petites facettes de ce kaléidoscope. Chacun maitrisant un petit morceau du puzzle. L'agroforesterie est comme une matrice composée de multiples variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "1-Modèles: il n'y a pas une seule agroforesterie, il existe plusieurs modèles agroforestiers et silvo-pastoraux, il y a en fait autant de systèmes d'agroforesterie que d'exploitations. Comment gérer et rationaliser cela?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Enjeux: la plupart des enjeux de durabilité et des ODD (objectifs du Developpement Durable) et la plupart des éléments de notre vie sont interconnectés avec l'agroforesterie et les arbres: les plus classiques: air, eau, sol, biodiversité, sécurité alimentaire, etc., et un enjeu qui devient central: le changement climatique, tant l'atténuation que l'adaptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Échelle: c'est une autre dimension essentielle de l'agroforesterie, l’agroforesterie étant considérée depuis longtemps comme une pratique marginale, réservée aux petits agriculteurs des pays en développement. Nous voyons que maintenant l'agroforesterie s'applique aussi à l'agriculture à grande échelle des pays industrialisés. Comment changer d'echelle ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Temps: c'est une variable clé de l'équation, entre les enjeux à court terme et à long terme des modèles agroforestiers, un élément critique dans le traitement des arbres. Ils apportent leurs bénéfices sur le long terme, alors comment gérer cela dans une société du court terme?\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Écosystèmes: L'agroforesterie varie beaucoup entre les divers écosystèmes, le climat et les conditions géographiques, entre l'agroforesterie tropicale et l'agroforesterie tempérée, il peut y avoir beaucoup de différence dans la conception, la mise en œuvre, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Parties prenantes: des agriculteurs aux éleveurs, en passant par les chercheurs, les acteurs publics et privés et le public, L'Agroforesterie doit traiter avec tous les types de parties prenantes pour que son modèle soit compris, adopté et diffusé. Comment communiquons-nous avec chaque intervenant et comment favorisons-nous la communication entre eux?\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment pouvons-nous naviguer dans ce Kaleidoscope? Lorsque nous sommes confrontés à toute cette complexité, nous pouvons avoir le sentiment que plus nous apprenons, moins nous en savons. Dans tous les cas, nous devons collaborer, briser les silos et encourager les collaborations transversales. Donc, comme il est impossible de résumer les principales conclusions de la conférence, j'ai demande aux participants et aux organisateurs quelles étaient leurs principales conclusions et leurs appels à agir.\n",
      "\n",
      "Voici ce que j'ai obtenu, résumé en 15 points:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Nous avons tous été impressionnés par toute l'énergie, la motivation que nous pouvions ressentir ici, la mobilisation incroyable venue du Monde entier, les organisateurs en premier lieu, mais aussi tous les participants. Nous sommes une belle famille d'Agroforestiers, nous pouvons être fiers de nous-mêmes, il y a un formidable esprit entre nous et un elan collectif.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Nous devons collaborer davantage entre scientifiques et les scientifiques avec la société et le public. Nous sommes tous invités à adhérer à l'Union internationale pour l'agroforesterie.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Nous devons simplifier, l'agroforesterie est tellement complexe, comment la rendre compréhensible, acceptable et adoptée par tous ?\n",
      "\n",
      "4) il y a un fort sentiment que l'élan est là pour l'agroforesterie maintenant. La présence massive du public dimanche avec plus de 1900 personnes en était une preuve irréfutable.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Pourtant, nous pensons toujours être au stade de validation du concept. Il est temps de passer à la vitesse supérieure.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Nous sommes condamnes à réussir compte tenu des enjeux, \"Go big ou Go Home.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Le café et le cacao sont d'excellents exemples pour l'agroforesterie. Pourrions-nous réussir si nous nous concentrions par exemple sur une culture telle que le cacao et la transformions en une culture 100% agroforestière, comme c'est actuellement en cours, puis en l'appliquant à d'autres cultures et industries?\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Le changement climatique est un sujet central: comment placer l'agroforesterie au cœur des solutions envisagées pour lutter contre le changement climatique?\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Nous avons soif de solutions positives et d'exemples concrets qui nous aident à faire connaître l’agroforesterie et à convaincre les autres acteurs de s’engager.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) L'Agroforesterie signifie la fin de la ségrégation entre forêts et cultures, ainsi que la fin de la ségrégation entre le monde scientifique, les politiques et la société, y compris les secteurs public et privé. C'était le thème de ce congrès. Comment mettre fin aux ségrégations et à la pensée en silo ?\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Il est nécessaire de centraliser la voix de tous les acteurs de l’agroforesterie, de centraliser et d’orienter la stratégie de recherche, de donner la priorité à certains thèmes spécifiques, d’axer les priorités régionales, par culture, par thème et par activité , secteur, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) Comment inviter davantage d’entreprises et d’autres parties prenantes, telles que des fonds publics, à s’engager tous pour l'agroforesterie ?\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Il est difficile de gérer et de suivre les impacts de l'agroforesterie, par nature, de long terme, dans un monde court-termiste.\n",
      "\n",
      "15) Pour resumer, les principaux défis sont les suivants: comment collaborer, définir les priorités de recherche, encourager l’adoption par les agriculteurs, petits et grands, de tous les pays du Monde, définir la feuille de route, comment faire le lien avec l’Agenda Global tel que les ODD (Objectifs du Developpement Durable ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ce sont quelques-uns des retours des participants et des organisateurs, mais cela ne résume pas tout le congrès et tout le potentiel de l'agroforesterie à de multiples niveaux. L'agroforesterie a en effet des impacts positifs holistiques: économiques, sociaux, environnementaux, culturels et même spirituels. Les arbres nous connectent à nouveau avec la nature et mettent en question notre relation avec le vivant. Les arbres nous relient à l'esprit de la forêt et à la conscience globale pour une relation plus équilibrée avec la nature. L’avenir est a l'agroforesterie, au nom de la preservation de nos ecosystemes et des generations futures. La conference s'est achevee sur un appel vibrant a tous les acteurs pour s'engager pour l'agroforesterie: pouvoir publics, entreprises, scientifiques et academiques, et chacun de nous, citoyens. Let's make our Planet treed Again !\n",

      "👉 On garde son calme surtout et on ne réagit pas. En effet, si vous réagissez, votre bébé va observer que le fait de faire tomber l'aliment au sol déclenche une réaction chez vous. Il va alors multiplier cette expérience pour continuer l'interaction avec vous.\n",
      "👉 On veille à proposer des aliments que le bébé arrive facilement à attraper.\n",
      "👉 On ne ramasse les aliments qu'à la fin du repas.\n",
      "👉 On propose 2-3 aliments pour un débutants. Si vous proposez trop d'aliments, votre bébé va être hyper stimulé et de ce fait va moins explorer, plus vite se lasser et rapidement jeter le repas présenté.\n",
      "👉 On peut apprendre au bébé à poser l'aliment en question dans un récipient ou à vous le donner lorsque vous sentez qu'il va le jeter au sol.\n",
      "👉 Si ce comportement vient d'un ennuie, on réduit un peu la taille des aliments.\n",
      "👉 S'il ne veut plus manger, on stop le repas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment éviter le gaspillage ? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "👉 Vous pouvez vous équipe d'un plateau bavoirs. Vous en trouverez chez Tidy Tot France ou chez La dame des gribouillis Ils seront parfaits pour limiter le nombre d'aliments au sol.\n",
      "👉 Une nappe au sol qui va vous permettre de récupérer les aliments propres. S'ils sont cassés, écrasez-les à la fourchette et étalez-les sur un transporteur comme @Lepaindesfleurs Pour les autres, vous pourrez les mettre au frais et les proposer lors d'un autre repas.\n",

Pour toutes demandes d'informations et souscriptions, contactez-moi en Mp ou via mon site www.comme-des-grands-dme.com Vous avez oublié une raison . Il veux attirer le chien 🤣🤣🤣 Ma fille jette tout depuis quelques semaines. Elle va sur ces 9 mois. J'ai l'impression que c'est l'ennuie. Je devrais peut être songer à réduire la taille du coup 🤔 Chez nous c'est c ustensiles qu'il jette après chaque bouchée 🙈🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️ sinon pour les aliments en effet il le fait quand il veut plus de l'aliment en question ou kan il a fini Mon bébé a 7 mois et est en dme depuis 1 mois. Il a goûté quelques aliments au début et ensuite plus rien.. Il prend l'aliment proposé, semble dérangé par la texture et jette directement (sans porter à sa bouche) .. Les pains des fleurs châtaignes c'est presque la seule chose qu'il accepte pour le moment.. Ça me décourage ☹️ Liz Liz Alors moi franchement je me sentais démuni face à mon bébé qui jetter tout 😞😞 puis finalement j'en ai parler autour de moi et ont ma conseillé de lui mettre une balle à côté de lui et de lui expliquer que la balle il peut la jetter sa fais 1 semaine que j'utilise cette astuce et bizarrement sa fais 1 semaine que je retrouve un sol nickel a le fin du repas 💪💪 bébé a 17 mois et il a jetter la balle seulement 2/3 fois maintenant il observe le long du repas mes il a vraiment compris que les aliments ne vont pas au sol 😍😍 Ici aussi elle jette a nouveau, elle a 16mois.. On a pensé que c'était les dents, ça fait bien 3 semaines... (ceci dit il y en a encore qui poussent donc c'est peut-être ça). Comme elle ne mange quasi rien, et que sa courbe de poids n'est pas folle, on a du mal à la sortir de table. Surtout que chez elle ça ne semble pas vouloir dire qu'elle n'en veut plus !\n",
      "On a tout essayer : avoir l'air de rien (au bout d'un moment on craque . Et puis elle a un très bon lancer, et la laisser lancer la fourchette c'est bof), lui suggèrer a chaque fois de donner, ou poser (échec), hausser un peu le ton et dire non (échec). Du coup j'appréhende chaque repas :(\n",

      "#Cryptorchidie (testicule non descendu)\n",
      "\n",
      "Le terme cryptorchidie vient du grec « kryptos » qui signifie caché et « orkhis », que l’on traduit par testicule.\n",
      "L'autre appellation plus connue est le « testicule non descendu »\n",
      "\n",
      "La cryptorchidie est une anomalie fœtale de l’appareil génital masculin résultant d’un défaut de migration de l’un ou des deux testicules de l’abdomen vers les bourses pendant la grossesse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cette malformation touche 20 à 30% des garçons prématurés et 2 à 4% des nouveaux -nés à terme.\n",
      "\n",
      "L’anomalie touche majoritairement (80% des cas) un seul testicule.\n",
      "\n",
      "La cryptorchidie est à différencier de deux autres pathologies :\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸L’ectopie testiculaire, une pathologie peu fréquente caractérisée par une localisation du testicule en dehors des bourses et en dehors du trajet normal de migration (à l’inverse de la cryptorchidie où le testicule reste sur le trajet de migration, donc soit au niveau de l’abdomen ou de l’aine) ;\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Le testicule oscillant ou ascenseur correspondant à une remontée en haut des bourses ou de l’aine du testicule lors de la contraction du muscle le recouvrant. Cette anomalie ne nécessite aucun traitement (éventuellement le replacement du testicule par palpation).\n",
      "Elle disparaît spontanément à la puberté.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ FACTEURS DE RISQUES\n",
      "\n",
      "L’origine précise de la cryptorchidie est encore méconnue de nos jours bien que l’hypothèse la plus probable soit une anomalie hormonale durant la grossesse.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸On connaît plusieurs facteurs susceptibles d’augmenter le risque de cryptorchidie à la naissance :\n",
      "\n",
      "La prématurité ou un faible poids à la naissance ;\n",
      "La naissance par le siège ;\n",
      "L’existence de malformations génitales chez le père ou les frères ;\n",
      "L’exposition à des perturbateurs endocriniens (pesticides, polluants, parabens, phtalates, etc.)\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ SYMPTÔMES\n",
      "\n",
      "La cryptorchidie ne comporte aucun symptôme.\n",
      "Cependant, si le testicule ne se remet pas en place et en l’absence de traitement, des complications existent :\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Une infertilité résultant d’une température inadéquate pour permettre la production de spermatozoïdes. Le risque d’infertilité est évalué à 5% en cas de cryptorchidie unilatérale et 50% lorsqu’elle touche les deux testicules. Un traitement par chirurgie peut réduire le risque de moitié\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Un cancer du testicule, qui reste rare, mais tout de même la première cause de cancer chez les 20 à 35 ans ;\n",
      "Une torsion du testicule ;\n",
      "Un traumatisme du testicule, en cas de pression sur l’aine.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ DIAGNOSTIC\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Le diagnostic repose sur la palpation des bourses du nouveau-né dès la naissance lors de l’examen médical systématique à la maternité.\n",
      "En cas de cryptorchidie, le médecin de famille examine régulièrement le petit jusqu’à ses 6 mois.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jusqu’à l’âge de 6 mois, voire 1 an, le testicule peut descendre spontanément et la cryptorchidie disparaître.\n",
      "La palpation s’effectue en position allongée sur le dos avec les jambes légèrement fléchies. L’enfant doit être calme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Après 6 mois, l’examen peut s’effectuer assis en tailleur. L’objectif est de localiser le testicule absent de la bourse et dans un second temps de l’examiner afin de vérifier qu’il n’est pas atrophié.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lorsque le médecin détecte une absence de testicule dans la bourse, il essaye d’en déterminer la localisation. Il peut être trouvé par palpation lorsqu’il se trouve au-dessus de la bourse ou au niveau de l’aine (60% des cas)\n",
      "\n",
      "En revanche, lorsque le testicule est dans l’abdomen, il n’est pas repérable par palpation et des examens complémentaires sont nécessaires.\n",
      "\n",
      "Si le médecin a pu palper le testicule, il va alors examiner sa consistance et sa forme afin de s’assurer qu’il n’est pas atrophié. Il recherche en parallèle d’autres anomalies pouvant coexister comme un hypospadias, un micropénis (pénis de petite taille) ou une hernie inguinale.\n",
      "\n",
      "🔸Des examens complémentaires peuvent être prescrits en cas de cryptorchidie bilatérale, associée à une autre anomalie ou lorsque le testicule n’est pas palpable :\n",
      "\n",
      "Echographie abdominale pour localiser le testicule ;\n",
      "Bilan sanguin pour détecter une anomalie hormonale ;\n",
      "Exploration de la cavité abdominale par coelioscopie.\n",
      "\n",
      "➡️ TRAITEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "Au-delà de 1 an, une cryptorchidie doit être traitée. Une intervention chirurgicale appelée « orchidopexie » permet de repositionner correctement le testicule.\n",
      "C’est le traitement de référence.\n",
      "\n",
      "L’orchidopexie doit être réalisée entre les 1 an et 2 ans du petit garçon.\n",
      "L’intervention nécessite une anesthésie générale et se déroule le plus souvent en ambulatoire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dans la majorité des cas, soit 90%, l’opération se déroule en un seul temps. Sinon, une seconde intervention est nécessaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lorsque le testicule est localisé dans l’abdomen, une coelioscopie est nécessaire afin de déterminer sa position et son état (s’il est atrophié ou non).\n",
      "Dans ce cas, l’intervention se déroule alors en deux temps.\n",
      "En cours d’opération, le chirurgien vérifie la taille et la consistance du testicule.\n",
      "\n",
      "En cas d’anomalie, il peut décider de le retirer. Une prothèse à visée esthétique peut être proposée à la puberté.\n",
      "\n",
      "Le traitement ne réduit pas le risque de développer un cancer du testicule après l’adolescence, mais facilite la surveillance médicale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Les complications liées à l’intervention sont rares : hématome, infection du testicule ou remontée du testicule nécessitant une seconde chirurgie.\n",
      "\n",
      "Après l’intervention, une surveillance régulière reste de rigueur pour vérifier que le testicule ne remonte pas.\n",
      "Les parents doivent palper régulièrement les bourses du petit garçon, par exemple après la toilette, pour vérifier sa présence dans la bourse et que sa taille corresponde à celle du second testicule.\n",
      "A partir d’un certain âge, le garçon réalise lui-même la surveillance par autopalpation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il existe un traitement médical sous forme d’injections intramusculaires à base d’hormone. Ce traitement n’est utilisé que dans certaines indications. Ces résultats sont très variables.\n",

      "Allaitement et DME\n",
      "\n",
      "La DME est-elle seulement possible pour les bébés qui sont allaités ? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Un bébé qui est allaité, a durant ses 6 premiers mois appris à bien utiliser ses mandibules et aura donc de la facilité, lors de l’apprentissage de la mastication. D’autre part, comme il a toujours bu à la demande et sans que l’on puisse contrôler ses quantités, on aura plus facilement tendance, à prendre du recul quand aux quantités d’aliments qu’il aura mangé. La maîtrise des signaux de satiété est dans ce cas totalement contrôlée et ce même une fois la diversification débutée. Pour autant, la DME peut tout à fait être pratiquée par les bébés alimentés avec du lait artificiel. Ils auront seulement un peu moins d’acquis, lorsqu’ils débuteront. Mais pas de panique, tout se mettra très vite en place !\n",
      "\n",
      "Peut-on proposer les mêmes aliments, que bébé soit allaité ou non ?🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Pour rappel, le le lait occupe jusqu’à un an une place très importante et privilégiée dans l'alimentation de votre bébé, même s’il ne couvre plus à 100 % ses besoins. Que votre enfant soit allaité ou non, vous pourrez lui présenter les mêmes aliments. Ce qui est important c'est de ne pas remplacer une tétée/biberon que votre bébé prend par des laitages, car ils ne couvriront pas aussi bien ses besoins nutritionnels. Les produits laitiers n'auront pas de réel intérêt hormis celui de la découverte et des tests allergiques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peut-on proposer de l’eau à un bébé allaité et si oui, quand le faire ? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Oui et d’ailleurs l’OMS le recommande dès le début de la diversification. L’eau fait partie intégrante de la diversification et participe à l’équilibre du transit et à rincer la bouche de votre bébé. Pour un bébé allaité, on veille à proposer l’eau lors des repas et tétées à volonté en dehors. Pour se faire, la babycup sera un outil d'apprentissage idéal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Peut-on utiliser le lait maternel dans des recettes, en remplacement du lait de vache ? 🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "Oui bien sûr ! Si vous avez la possibilité de tirer votre lait, profitez en pour l’utiliser dans vos recettes ! A vous les glaces de laits maternels, les pancakes et autres petits plaisirs ! Si ce n’est pas possible, vous pourrez dans ce cas utiliser du lait végétal ou du lait de vache, sans qu’il n’y ait de répercussion sur votre lactation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Et vous, comment vos bébés allaités vivent-ils leur diversification ?\n",
      "\n",

      "Je publie rarement des infos personnelles, mais voilà un bon moment que je souhaitais partager un petit bout de ce nouveau chemin que j'emprunte. Cela fait bientôt 10 ans que j’ai commencé à m’intéresser en profondeur aux enjeux systémiques de l’alimentation, en particulier aux implications des politiques alimentaires sur le réchauffement climatique et la baisse de bioversité. C’est notamment lorsque j’ai enseigné cette thématique, complexe mais passionnante, des \"enjeux mondiaux 2050\" à l’EPFL (école polytechnique de Lausanne) que j’ai pris conscience du cloisonnement des politiques alimentaires. Celles qui ont vocation à répondre aux enjeux nutritionnels individuels (thérapeutiques ou préventifs) intégrés dans les politiques de santé publique, n’incluent pas, voire s’opposent aux problématiques environnementales auxquelles nous sommes (et allons être de plus en plus) confrontés à titre collectif. Pour celles et ceux qui ont suivi mes formations ces dernières années, vous savez combien ce sujet m’est cher et le temps que je consacre à lire la littérature scientifique récente sur ce sujet. J’ai aussi beaucoup écrit mais je n’ai quasiment pas publié le contenu (il faut que j’y remédie !). Je travaille également sur un programme de recherche visant à démontrer la meilleure densité nutritionnelle des végétaux issus de la permaculture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bref, tout ceci pour dire que je me sentais un véritable inconfort intérieur, pour ne pas dire une incohérence à ne pas pouvoir mettre pleinement en pratique, à titre personnel, ces actes simples et pourtant ô combien essentiels. J’ai mis plusieurs années à « franchir le cap », mais surtout à trouver LE lieu pour me lancer dans l’aventure. C’est désormais chose faite depuis à peine quelques semaines. Me voici dans un corps de ferme à la campagne, avec quelques milliers de m2 occupés par des arbres fruitiers, un potager, un puits et même un four à pain ! Je ré-oriente progressivement mon temps pour en consacrer de plus en plus à mettre la « main dans la terre » et à apprendre, par la pratique, de ce concept magnifique qu’est la permaculture. Et c’est ce qui me pousse à écrire ce post : dans cette période bouleversante que nous sommes en train de vivre collectivement (à titre personnel, l'année 2020 aura été marquée par une rechute de neuroborréliose avec notamment une méningo-radiculite), je prends encore plus conscience du besoin de me sentir aligné avec mes convictions et mes aspirations. Les médias sont en train de nous asséner de nouvelles anxiogènes, nous subissons des décisions que nous savons incohérentes, à l’heure où nous devrions au contraire, concentrer nos forces à promouvoir ce qui renforce notre immunité et permet à cette incroyable machinerie cellulaire de s’exprimer pleinement, à savoir :\n",
      "- Bouger en plein air,\n",
      "- Manger des aliments bruts et de saison,\n",
      "- Nous apaiser émotionnellement et mieux dormir.\n",
      "Le mode de vie actuel nous amène progressivement mais indéniablement vers une situation biologique logique, à savoir l’existence d’une inflammation de bas-grade, caractéristique de toutes ces pathologies de civilisation que nous connaissons désormais que trop bien. Avec un peu de recul et un brin d’analyse évolutionniste, on se dit d’ailleurs que nos cellules sont décidément dotées d’une incroyable capacité d’adaptation... Nous devrions en effet plutôt nous étonner de ne pas être plus malades au regard de ce que nous faisons subir à notre immunité ! Nous sommes bien loin de la réflexion vaccinale, je n’ai ni les compétences ni l’envie d’aborder le sujet, nombre d’experts (ou non-experts) s’en charge allègrement. Mais justement, si nous profitions de cette période pour repenser l’environnement dans lequel nous souhaitons évoluer, le mode de vie auquel nous aspirons pour respecter notre santé, mais aussi prendre soin de celle de nos enfants. Je partage d’ailleurs ici une photo des miens, ce que je n’ai jamais fait sur un réseau social. Car personnellement, c’est avant tout à eux que je pense pendant cette période. Je me dis simplement que, quoi qu’il advienne des décisions politiques et des orientations collectives à venir, il nous reste quand même un pouvoir incroyable, celui de décider mais surtout d’AGIR pour nous sentir alignés et cohérents avec les valeurs que nous souhaitons leur transmettre, à défaut de pouvoir leur garantir l’environnement que nous avons connu. Pour ma part (au-delà de ma passion pour la nutrition que vous connaissez bien !), je n’ai pas trouvé de solution plus efficace que de reprendre davantage contact avec la terre pour mieux transmettre, à mon échelle, à celles et ceux qui partagent cette vision. C’est parce que je prends chaque jour conscience du plaisir que procure la nature que je ne peux que vous inviter à faire de même (si tout ceci fait écho en vous), car je suis profondément convaincu que c’est à niveau que réside notre besoin (biologique) fondamental. Plus que jamais.\n",

      "\n",
      "Mais là n'est pas le sujet d'aujourd'hui...\n",
      "\n",
      "Hier quelques minutes avant la réunion, j'ai reçu un message d'une personne certainement bien intentionnée qui sur la base seule de la photo qui illustrait l'annonce m'expliquait que j'étais trop jeune et pas légitime pour pouvoir promouvoir l'Aïkido Takemusu.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tout d'abord effectivement la photo commence à dater et je remercie cette personne de me rappeler que le temps passe et qu'il n'y a pas de temps à perdre, une photo actuelle aurait peut être permis d'éviter ce genre de malentendu avec les cheveux gris j'aurai pu invoquer la sagesse et l'expérience de l'âge :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "Mais plus important cette démarche est une démarche que j'aurai pu moi même faire dans d'autres circonstances, j'aurai en effet pu envoyer ce genre de message pour questionner la légitimité d'une personne à la transmission d'un savoir ou la promotion d'un savoir.\n",
      "\n",

      "Je suis désolé mais non... L'avis d'une personne qui pratique depuis 1 an ou 2, n'a pas le même poids qu'un pratiquant de 10 ans ou de 20 ans... Il a le même droit à la parole, à l'expression à avoir et donner des avis, mais quand il s'agit d'un savoir précis dont la vision est encore parcellaire et débutante elle ne peut avoir le même poids.\n",

      "Internet aujourd'hui est un cadeau pour les possibilités que cela offre au quotidien mais également un fléau pour la préservation et développement de savoirs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Et pour répondre à cette personne, même si je me suis posé la question de la responsabilité vis à vis du savoir que j'ai plutôt que de ma légitimité, je voudrai l'informer des choses suivantes:\n",
      "\n",
      "J'ai commencé l'Aïkido à 17 ans à 29 ans je recevais le grade de 5ième dan soit seulement 12 années après mes débuts là ou il est en général nécessaire de pratiquer plus de 20 ans.\n",
      "\n",
      "A 25 ans j'étais invité en Chine, à Bornéo, à Singapour, en Georgie, à Kuala Lumpur, en Europe et aux quatre coins de France pour enseigner.\n",
      "\n",
      "En quelques années c'est plus de 100 séminaires d'Aïkido auxquels j'ai participé pour suivra mon Maître et apprendre à ses côtés.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quand la majorité des personnes de mon âge ne dormaient pas pour faire la fête, de mon côté je m'endormais sur le tatamis, dans l'entrée d'un hotel, sur le banc d'une gare ou d'un aéroport car j'essayais de me reposer entre 2 jours de pratique.\n",
      "\n",
      "J'ai vécu 'à l'ancienne\" sur les tatami pendant plusieurs mois à ne faire que cela étudier et pratiquer l'Aïkido, à l'isolement du monde, à terminer les cours en tombant dans les pommes de douleurs pour éprouver ma volonté d'apprendre.\n",
      "\n",
      "J'ai rencontrer et enseigner à des enseignants de toutes les cultures , j'ai pratiqué l'Aïkido sur la Grande Muraille de Chine, dans la Jungle de Bornéo, j'ai fait une intervention dans une grande Mosquée pour parler développement spirituel, j'ai développer une méthodologie et pédagogie qui permettent à tous de progresser sur la voie de l'Aïkido, je l'ai faite éprouvé par des enseignants, des élèves, des pratiquants avancés ou débutants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tout cela n'est qu'un bref aperçu de ce qui ne me rend forcément plus légitime qu'un autre mais qui me rend responsable d'un savoir qui ne m'appartient pas. Et en ce sens alors je suis légitime pour le faire perdurer.\n",

      "Post spécial pâques!!! La tradition d'offrir des œufs natures, puis décorés, teints ou travaillés est sans doute l'une des plus vieilles traditions du monde. Cette tradition se retrouve dans pleins de pays. Mais selon la région ou le pays, les histoires et traditions varient. Chez vous, c’est qui qui apporte les œufs ? La cloche ou le lapin ?? C’est quoi vos traditions ?\n",

      "Traditionnellement les œufs étaient peints ou plongés dans un mélange de colorant alimentaire, de vinaigre et d’eau ou de pleins de colorants naturels. Aujourd’hui ce sont plutôt des œufs en chocolat qui sont offerts aux enfants pendant la chasse aux œufs…. Oui, ok, j’avoue, le chocolat c’est très bon, mais toutes bonnes choses sont bien plus appréciées en modération. 😉 Une bonne leçon à apprendre à vos petits bouts dès le début.\n",

      "Louise Can you recall the Sunday lunch with veggies and chicken. It's the first food he hes rejected in 18 months. Can only put it down to a strong odour of garlic, who in their right mind has this stuff in baby food. What about jars of mouldy food bought from shop shelves ?!! Is there anything wrong with cow and gate 2 follow on milk??? WARNING: mums and dads that use cow and gate first infant milk please be aware my cousin had to take her little one to A and E (advised by her gp) today to be checked over after finding small shards of metal in her powder milk lucky enough she is fine thank god she has called them and made a complaint and they asked for the batch number and where it was purchased which was Savers in bexhill town and have told her they will recall that batch number and investigate further and get back to her I will get the batch number later off her and post on here I have called your helpline a number of times and been assured that a member of your investigation team will call me with information. This has NOT happened.\n",
      "The company is not forthcoming with how the food has been tampered with. It is disgraceful that you will not disclose full details to parents of the risks that our children have been exposed to. Please advise me how I escalate this complaint as your call centre staff are proving NO reassurance to me that my child has not been placed in danger. Do u need ur receipt to take them back as I had some delivered yesterday!! Will Cow and Gate please reply..in what way? My grandson was staying with us, and has had these jars over the last two days. He is drizzly today but how di we know if it's the fact he is teething or is it the food? Was it something like metal or is it some form of poison? I think its shocking that you're just saying if they're unwell for an unknown reason take them to the doctors...some insight into the tampering should be given as its causing mass concern over what we may or may not have fed our children and could potentially have made them Ill. Your statement is causing close to mass hysteria, confusion and concern.\n",
      "Should I be concerned for my daughter's safety or not?! I just fed our 7 month old daughter one of these jars for the first time today. Bought several of the flavours listed this week from Asda. Its all well and good saying jars from other stores not affected but Cow & Gate need to provide batch numbers and codes for us parents to double check. So my 10 month old baby is eating this.. what exactly is wrong with them??? I demand some kind of clarity, Any update on this?? Do we know what the potential tampering was as about time parents were advised. I'm personally avoiding buying any c&g jars from anywhere at the moment until I know what was wrong. We all need a little more information on this? Why only Tesco? As with a lot of people in these comments, our child has too been eating this food for the last few months.\n",
      "The recall notice does not carry enough information regarding the issue with the jars as to keep parents from worrying too much. Just tell the people what's wrong exactly. If a child can become ill from the food, let people know, if it's because the jar is the wrong shape or size, reassure them that's the issue. You now have parents worried about the health of their child, the compensation you'll give if they are ill, how long until it's sorted or is everyone going to have to go and buy a different brand of food. A vague statement is appalling by such a large company. I rang your care line before 10 a.m this morning as my grand daughter had been sick all night after eating one of these jars. I was told I would get an urgent call back. I have heard nothing . The child is now awaiting an ambulance. I would call this appalling customer service!!!! Okay. So, I've the same question. Will this recall be applicable to the same Cow and Gate food jars bought from Tesco two weeks ago? I still have 5/6 jars left at home. Please can you advise as I gave my baby some of these jars within the last 2-3 months? What is the nature of the contaminant and how might it have affected her? She had a few days of vomiting during this time but I just put it down to general unwellness / getting used to weaning. I'm now a bit worried! We really need to know if there are any potential long term implications from this. What have you given my daughter?! Has anyone actually had a phone call back from cow and gate yet? Thank you xx We have a young infant in our family who eats your product and was admitted to hospital the other day. What is the 'tampering'. What is involved. Answers please, now. My son has been eating these for the past two days. Being told that they have been tampered with is not good enough!!!! What has been done to them??? Do people need to get their babys tested for anything??? This isnt a time where you should be subtle with details. This needs to have more in for for the children that have already eaten this product it's obviously been recalled for a reason.... I'd go for a precautionary check up and why is it only Tesco surely the same product sent to other stores so student they be recalled also Little Tesco at Grovehill Hemel Hempstead is still selling this product!!! If these jars as dangerous from Tesco how more information please as my son has these and last few days been unwell Cow & Gate Uk.... are you able to provide an estimation of when we will be provided with more detail?\n",
      "Are we looking at the morning, a few days, a few weeks? In what way? what shoulld we look for? really straightforward\n",
      "questions. Is the recall just from tesco? Only alot of stores like asda, Boots etc sell these Jars! Cow & Gate UK please can you tell us why it’s only ones in Tesco that have been recalled, why not other stores? Surely as a batch it’s all made in the same factory?! My daughter is on cow & gate 7mth pudding jars and the 4-6mth jars plus cow & gate milk! If this is how you deal with this by not informing us why they’ve been recalled, I’ll be looking at another brand..!! I want to know if what I’m feeding my baby is safe!! My ten month old has been incredibly sick all through the night, and has been screaming in pain, is this a coincidence after eating several jars. I need to know what has happened to the food, has she been POISONED? We took the jars back to tescos in crewe, to find that the food was all still on the shelves and noone at tescos had a bloody clue, I'm beyond angry at how the situation has been handled!! My baby had one of these jars on Thursday night (he has them every night but this one in particular seems to have affected him. He was hot after eating the jar and I gave him neurofen then the next day his skin on his lips and his gums was white and peeling! I took him to the pharmacy for thrush cream and they said it was not thrush and that they didn’t know what it was and to see how he went and then I find out this has happened to the jars of food! I wish I could upload photos to show you all the skin peeling off his lips and mouth! I have messaged a few times asking for help getting my son his baby food, each time I get told there’s plenty of stock and you can’t help me..\n",

      "I cannot get this anywhere! My local co op was very helpful and let me buy the rest of the stock they had weeks ago but this has run out now.\n",
      "Cow and gate however have done nothing, really shocked how unhelpful you have been considering your products are for baby’s and toddlers. My daughter has been eating these for ages!! Now I’m sat worrying about her, which isn’t great at all especially as I already suffer from post natal anxiety!! Why can’t you tell us what is wrong with the jars??!!! It’s an absolute disgrace that you continually refuse to give any details about what’s actually happened, I use this food regularly, and the only answer I have received is that I precautionary. It’s not good enough! The company is more interested in damage control. I will never be buying anything from cow and gate again as I can’t seem to get any answers. Surely there’s an update on this case now? The product was re called well over 24 hours ago! How you deal with situations like this and the information you give your customers is vital and of the upmost importance. Cow & Gate need to provide more information than a recall and police are involved. My sons been eating the rice pudding and he’s been ill all week. I’m not happy with the lack of information released by you. I have bulk bought these from Boots as they had a deal on them. Mainly the spaghetti ones. Are the C&G 7+month old jars from Boots on? That’s all I need to know. Please can someone help let me know. Thank you Still no update on this C&G? My son had this food for dinner last night, the succulent pork, he vomited all night! What was in it? No answer on any of your numbers, tesco said your advice to them was to tell people go to hospital so I did, hospital has confirmed it was the food that made him sick. What do you intend to do for the children you have made sick? What was in the food you gave my son!\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it bits of metal like Heinz? What was it? I’ve brought a load of these from boots 3 days ago for my little boy. He’s had a couple of jars. Just wondering if the ones from boots also need to go back? I’ve just opened a potato and turkey roast 7+ months jar & it has mould. This was not brought at Tesco these have been purchased from Morrison’s.. so will it be all the 7+ jars that need to be recalled? You really need to explain in what context these products may have been tampered with in your press release, so that we as concerned parents know what we are looking for and understand the risk to our children. Especially this time of year when illnesses are common and we may just assume symptoms are due to this rather than a result of being fed contaminated baby food! Or are we looking for things such as sharp or alien objects in the food itself?! Anyone know the batch codes please?!... just received my email from Tesco’s saying I’ve purchased the ones that need recalling twins been eating them over the past couple of weeks!! Please can you let me know when your PR team is going to release an updated press statement on the situation. It has been 72 hours since the news of the recall. There are a lot of worried parents including myself whose babies have consumed the contents of the jars recalled and need further clarity, as their health is of paramount importance to us. So I have jars from Asda, boots and Tesco... I don’t know which ones came from where?! Hi good day. Im a mother of 19 months old son and this is my first time to use a cow& gate formula milk from 1-2 years level.I was actually using another brand of formula milk but unfortunately it was not available here in the UK so i shifted on this formula. Is there any precautions and or safety concerns regarding this product. Please i need your help. Thank you. Never will I buy from you again and I will be reminding people of this for years to come. Your handling of information is appaling. I’ve literally fed my daughters these for two days and the jars are from bloody Tesco!!!! What way have they been tampered with and should I be worried??? Cow & Gate it’s been a week! A week since you’ve scared the life out of parents, a week since my daughter ate one of these jars that I had literally brought just 1 of because I couldn’t feed her the same dinner as us that night!! And a WEEK of her being poorly, up in the nights unwell - we need to know what is going on!! A week on you must have more answers!!!! Do I take it as coincidence or reasoning as to why my little boy hasn't been well for over a week and has been refusing to eat any jar food I've offered him?! This is the only brand we use and he is dairy allergic. We need to know what our kids are at risk of or have been exposed to! Cow & Gate UK are you going to elaborate? What exactly are you suggesting these jars could have been tampered with and what are the dangers if one has been consumed? My baby has recently eaten some of the dessert ones, and may be a coincidence but he hasn't been very well lately! More information would be appreciated for people who have already given their baby these products. What about the 6 month ones and I got them from Asda's. What's the batch numbers from the tampered with food jars? So we can check all the jars we've got at home.. think that would help parents from being scared to feed their children.. I want to know what tampering with means exactly? My child has been eating these products for the past couple of weeks and you are just saying you believe they may have been tampered with. So how exactly is my child going to become unwell well thinking about it she hasnt been herself the past week... so I would like to know facts exactly what has happened you cannot recall these products and not give us fact when we have our children's health and safety to worry about This is very concerning can I ask long have they been on shelfs for and not known how long they may have been tampered with as my baby boy has been unwell since the week before Christmas... he is 7 months ... just wondering if this is related to how he has been... choking being sick boking etc he has numerous trips to the doctors and the hospital... can u please give me more information pleasei have just went and bought all new food for him Can I ask why only now has this come out when they got recalled about 2 weeks ago as I tried to buy some in tesco and would not scan just said not allowed to sell them. Cow & Gate UK is there an update yet as to how the jars have been tampered with. Seems a long time not to have heard anything at all. This is absolutely appalling!! For shame Cow & Gate & Tesco!!\n",

      "Worried parents want DETAILS not party spin lines. “Tampered with”?!?! What does that mean?? & what risks are our children at?? If you know it has been tampered with, you know how & you know likely consequences etc so worried parents saying their children are unwell deserve more than a glib and trite blanket response to see a healthcare professional. INFORMATION and DETAILS needed.\n",

      "Cow & Gate you’ve lost my custom! Please elaborate Cow & Gate UK on how exactly these jars have been tampered with? My baby son has eaten your listed pudding and fruit jars from Tesco for months now. Very concerned. Only a few days ago I have been in contact via email for the first time, over large chunks of apple (a very easy choking hazard for a seven month old baby) in your Apple, Pear & Raspberry 7 month plus jar. I don't think your repetitive explanation responses to these posts give us parents much trust with your products. Still no answers nearly a month later. The word ‘tampered’ can be a very scary thing to hear and could mean anything.\n",
      "Many children including my own have been very poorly shortly after eating your products that you say may have been ‘tampered’ with yet you continue to hide behind generic statements and withhold information.\n",
      "If someone said they had tampered with your car, would you drive it? I think not!\n",
      "You have pulled thousands of pounds worth of product from the shelves. Regardless of what you say about “our children’s interest comes first” I do not believe this would have been done without very strong suspicion and an idea of in what way they were tampered with.\n",
      "If your customer care team do not know, perhaps you should tell them, instead of withholding the information and hiding behind them repeating the same drawl.\n",
      "Questions need answering now. Do you need a receipt as I bought them a couple of weeks ago so will probably have thrown it ?? Why specially tesco? Why not all shops that are selling them? Does someone at the packing station have a grudge against Tescos? I've bought from Tesco and from Morrison's and they've got mixed up, do you have a bar code I could identify Tesco jars with? Hi cow and gate I certainly won't be buying another product of yours after watching my 10 month old grandson being Ill with sickness the runs in pain and a temperature for the last 3 days and only thing he has eaten is your jars bought from Tesco not happy we haven't got anything to tell the drs Sick of reading 'we cant tell you but if you're worried see a healthcare professional' I am a said healthcare professional and CANNOT help if I've no idea what a child has ingested or been exposed to. What do you want? Every single child with any kind of symptom to have full screening blood tests and scans? Not going to happen. Health care professionals cannot help until you release more information they can only offer symptom management. Information needs to be shared in order to help our poorly children. Can you explain why only Tesco as I have sum from ASDA and Morrison’s and my child as eaten these Cow & Gate UK hi, just wondering if there is a date when these jars will be returning to Tescos? I ask as I live somewhere were tescos is the only real option, without spending 24 hours on a boat 😁 Can u tell me why the cow and gate 7months + jars are back on sale in tescos Belmont Hereford for delivery! Yet you are still\n",
      "Refusing too tell\n",

All +4months etc what's going on?! Still no further information Cow and Gate and no return call from the ‘investigation team’. Appalling customer service and lack of transparency. Putting children at risk and not informing parents of the actual risk is unforgivable. Still no answers would any one please say if your child has experienced any funny symptoms or been ill after they have had any of the above jars ? My daughter was sick in her cot last week hours after eating the harvest chicken and has had a terrible rash on bum to the point where it’s bleeding and bad diarrhoea at times probably faster working it out out selfs than cow and gate! So when are we going to find out exactly whats wrong with the jars?! You have to wonder what they are hiding, how can the doctor or other professional treat an I'll child when we can't even tell them what could be wrong. Cow & Gate UK you need to be more open here, this isn't good enough My 8 month old baby has cried all evening and all night till 5 o'clock this morning then was awake again by six. It's very unusual for him. He eats these foods and I've just seen this post and starting to think it's the food.... Us as parents need to know what had gone in to our childs system that shouldn't have . We have the right to know. I’m worried sick about this recall. My baby ate 5 of these jars and the details cow & gate and Tesco are giving are just not good enough. What’s the point going to a GP if you can’t explain any details to them?!? My baby has a snotty nose at the moment... is that caused by the jars? I know that’s unlikely but my point is I would go to a doctor and say my baby has x, y & z symptoms and explain about the jars and the doctor would be able to do NOTHING with that information without knowing what the risks are from the jars in the first place!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Stop covering your arses for legal purposes and put worried parents out of their misery. These are OUR babies, not yours... we deserve to know more information so we can accurately assess our babies health & behaviour following on from this!!!!! Sick of this brand of baby food . I am no longer buying cow& gate foods for my boy . I had porridge and found plasic in his porrige and now twice the jars have been called back . What is going on this is babys food and i can no longer trust feeding my child anything from the cow&gate brands now . I've been using these jars for the last 2 months, all from Tesco,Tampered with isnt enough info, I'd also like to know the batch number please as I cant find it written in the post x Just when to Tesco is Risca and there have now pulled all the cow and gate jars completely ..I have some at home +4months feel these are safe to use now !!! My son has been eating these for the past two weeks from Tesco? Need more information on this as he’s not been settling until he’s been sick lately. Tampered with in what way ?\n",

Instead of worrying people to death. Why not tell them the TRUTH!!!!!! Is it just Tesco?? How far back are the dates your concerned about? When is this from recent batches or a while ago Isit just Tesco? People are so lazy it doesn't take long to cook a batch or just make a bit extra of yours Anyone been to there local Tesco’s lately? It’s been over two weeks I’ve now noticed there are no cow & gate jars at-all on shelf’s like even the younger ones? Anyone else noticed this? Yet still no answers ?!.... Any update for us all? Which police force is investigating this if it is a criminal matter? Its pretty dissapointing to see this when you've been feeding your baby with them for the past month ... and even more dissapointing that they've travelled 2000 km for my baby because I thought they were better than the local ones... Do you need a receipt? Is it just jars from tesco You need to explain to these poor people how your goods have been tampered with?! Is it just Tesco’s these are being recalled from? I buy mine in Asda!! I bought these jars from Tesco about a week ago and now the baby has awful thrush in her mouth. Her tongue and lips look red and sore and are covered in white material. What is in the jars that has contaminated them? Is it a fungus type thing that could cause thrush? This is so frustrating CowandGate 'tampered with' wat the hell does this mean?? Is the jars filled with aids, ebola or rabies????? Did someone put some kind of fluid in the jars? Uuurrgghhhh U NEED TO TELL US WHAT KIND OF DANGER YOU HAVE PUT OUR BABIES IN!!!!🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡 Why is it only Tesco stores Y is cow and gate not stating what exactly is wrong with these jars surely with the risk and if they are being removed from shelves they should be made to say what exactly is wrong with them this would seriously put me of buying any of there products in the future. These are babies who could have been affected by jars of food you produce I dont feel it a good enough reason to just say dont feed them to babies they should be made to say y. Think of all the babies around country who would have consumed these products in past few days and they cant even tell parents y they shouldn't be feeding there child with them it's a disgrace!!!! My son has eaten 4 jars, he is not well now!! Is that something to do with the food in the jar?? Cow & Gate UK are we any further forward in understanding what has happened with the products please? I have two half used can I return them too? Stop pissing about and tell us what is potentially wrong with the jars, no point trying to withhold the information for PR purposes the damage is already done on that front, you will have more chance or winning back trust if you share all the information you have ASAP as it will come out eventually anyway My baby is very ill after eating a Cow & Gate jar of 4-6 month butternut squash and salmon on Monday. We purchased them from Tesco’s Dunstable last Sunday. She started to refuse the food and then projectile vomited and since then has had horrendous diarrhoea. We have been at our local hospital twice. When I cleaned the jar and lid there was a lump of congealed food across the inside of the lid. I contacted C&G on Thursday, they were going to email me details so I can send them photos of the congealed food but I’ve not received their email. I have received a box in the post to send the jar and congealed lump to them.\n",
      "I will never buy this food again Are thay just the ones bought from tesco??? Is there a problem with the 4 month + jars today Any parents who wish to complain i wouldn't bother there unprofessional response just makes angry parents more angry. Truely shocking oh and they dont have a complaints procedure. I expect knowledge from a quality control manager the call i had from him well i was so shocked i forgot his name appalling how cow and gate trade is beyond me. Never using this brand again Any updates please, I really need to know the reason and what happened. Hi, I called the number listed at the end of the bbcnews article at 9.30am today asking for further information and was told I would receive a call back later in the day but I did not receive one. I appreciate there may have been a large number of calls to deal with but if a call back is promised this should be acted on. In this situation where the welfare of babies is concerned I think the customer service and reassurance to worried parents is poor and disappointing for a brand that should be trusted. Still no updates? We’ve now stopped using all cow and gate products @Cow & Gate Uk\n",

      "/?d=n DO NOT BUY ANY JARS I JUST BROUGHT ONE FROM MORRIONS THE LID HAS DUST HAIRS IT LOOKS LIKE IT HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR HOURS I AM FUMING THIS IS A JOKE Okay so this happened 4 weeks ago. I have had no email off Tesco. No information provided I actually had to ask at my tesco why the baby jars were not there! And still nobody told me they had be recalled due to suspected tampering. My daughter has eaten all of the jars we had as I shop monthly. I am absolutley fuming we are well within our rights to know what our children have consumed. Telling us if they are unwell take them to the GP is all well and good but when we dont know what it is they have eaten can the gp really help? No! Plus we need to know if there could be long term effects. These are little babies we are talking about here. And if as you say the authorities are involved then it is serious. I want to know what I could have possibly fed my daughter.. We have rights. And there is still no further information since you posted this. Its discusting absolutley no communication with worried parents. VERY DANGEROUS COMPANY. After finding plastic in my babies food - brought from MORRISONS - I contacted cow and gate they ignored me until posted on here! They ask me to send jar and plastic to them, which I did a few weeks ago and have HEARD NOTHING again!! I will be contacting all baby groups and pushing things further with ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH as it feels they have got the evidence and no not making any effort to to contact me or let people know there are STILL ISSUES with their products!!! Disgusting opened some food with an expiry of 2022 to find its full of mould!!! Carlie Jones need to check jars x Cow & Gate UK you have gone very quiet! Any news yet!!! Kayleigh Parnaby i got loads delivered with my Tesco shop last night 🤦‍♀️ Jess Thompson don’t know if you use these with Huddy? Xx Ruairí Mjölnir Mc Caughley Sarah Willis check all jars. Keep watch on twins, they've had bolognese & garden pea and Turkey today 😡 Jodie Jones cant remember if you shopped at tesco x Cow & Gate UK can we have an update? Mandy Bamford mine are from Tesco online 🤢 Chelsea Grubb could u tag Brooklyn Gemma Watson just Incase you’ve bought any xx Kelly-rose Ward. Do you get jars? X Any news yet Cow & Gate UK!!! Carmen Hughes x Any news on what happened?! Our children were eating these and you haven’t said anything. So stressful and worrying all of this and cow and gate are being so vague. It feels like they are not understanding how serious this is. I saw some of the jars effected today still on a shelf in our tesco so i let another mum know. Not knowing and having no answers is so worrying. After our lil one has eaten this recently im worried to sleep incase something happens in her sleep. We dont know what is wrong or what symptoms it could cause its the worse feeling for the parents 😡 One of the many reasons you should try homemade food as much as possible. This big company's can't be trusted Oh well... Obviously no one is happy, but let's face it, if there was tampering just in Tesco, I'm more worried about their safety than Cow & Gate's!\n",
      "If anyone else is upset at this, it must be themselves... Surely they'd say what happened if they weren't waiting for the police to find out. If anything I trust Cow & Gate even more for acting quickly and taking a big hit for something that is a precaution...I'\n",
      "d probably avoid Tesco though! My daughter has been ill with similar symptoms that a few above have mentioned.id like to know if coincidence or if there was something in the food i should be concerned about! So have Tesco tampered with them then? If all other supermarkets are safe, I'm guessing it's something they have done🤷they recalled Heinz as well. If it's not Tesco & it's C&G why aren't they all being recalled?seems very strange🤔 w & Gate UK loving your repetitive answers. We aren't stupid, we understand you can't divulge all the information, but PLEASE give us parents something to assure us, what symptoms are we meant to look for...??\n",

Wanting a reputable, well known reliable company if you know of any private companies that will test them for me then please let me know I’ve just checked Tesco website for the batch numbers as others here have suggested and I can’t find them on the product recall list.\n",

The fact you have no idea whats wrong and what it could of done to our kids is alarming especially for a large company like yourselves We are complaining about the slack attitude from cow and gate it is so alarming. We have No idea what to expect from our baby eating the jars recalled they have no idea it is shocking!!! So us worried parents dont know what will happen due to our baby eating this we are very angry concerned parents 😡 Shain Shanjab wtf 'precautionary measure recall'.\n",

      "Tampered with in what way as I have fed my twins these jars? Should I be worried?Do they need to see a doctor?! Jeeez! Reply to peoples worries and concerns! Don't think I will be buying cow and gate again! Hi, we had an incident on Friday regarding one if your jars but it wasn't purchased at Tesco.\n",
      "I PM'd you last night when I became aware of the recall if you could check please. I have fed three of these jars to my son in the last week. Is it a foreign body? Or some kind of toxic substance that may have been in the product?? What would cause my child to become ‘unwell’ I think as parents we should be fully exposed to the truth of what kind of tampering could have taken place. Im quite worried So i spoke to cow and gate, and the lady was lovely but didnt know much.\n",
      "All she knew was a jar has been tempered with so tesco have recalled all jars, she doesnt know how it was tempered with, but said an investigation is taking place so will have some more info soon. My baby had a banana crumble not last Thursday the Thursday after and my friends twins did for nearly two weeks now they iv been sick with diarrhoea high temperature and rash in there mouths I know it wasn’t a sickness bug as none of my family got it and it don’t last that long I’m now getting my babies poo tested as she still being sick I think this is a discussing I won’t to no what my babies eaten Where do Cow & Gate and Tesco expect a heath professional to start. A baby has eaten food potentially contaminated with WHAT? There is surely a duty of care to disclose the exact nature of the tampering and what any side effects may be. Incredibly poor generic responses to worried parents. If my child were possibly affected as well as seeing a Doctor I would personally make a full written complaint to both companies so they would be duty bound to initiate their complaints procedure and I would also contact in writing the Food Standards Agency and Trading Standards. I hope no children become seriously ill due to this 💕 Does anyone know what they may have been tempered with, i have called cow and gate and ment to get a call back, my daughter has one jar a day for dinner and the last couple of days she has been unwell, lose nappies, very sleepy, off food and sick when has eaten, i also phoned 111 but they dont know anything about the recall. I am starting to really worry about this, if anyone has anymore info please say. Any news on how the investigation is going or what was in the food we fed our children that made them sick? How about getting on with the investigation regarding the bug that was found in my sons bag of cow and gate porridge ? Trying to fob me off iv told you il take it to the papers I even have his medical record not even 12 hours after eating from the same bag ( before we found the bug in the bottom) he was admitted to the local a&e department with high temperature and vomiting My 15 month old about 3-4 weeks ago had a couple of jars of the recalled baby food from tesco ... I always cook fresh food except on these two occasions as I was out and about during our Christmas holiday. Since she developed a nasty rash...she never had any skin issues, same detergent, same toiletry (only natural bio creams), no changes in my diet (I'm still breastfeeding).\n",
      "She now has large red spots an also patches of red dry skin all around her body. The doctors couldn't give an answer as to what might have caused it. She also has a cough...(not cold related though). Cow&gate can u tell me if this has anything to do with your recalled baby food? I'm a bit confused as to whether tampering/\n",
      "issue was with Cow and Gate therefore why are other retailers not affected, however if a Tesco issue then surely this could potentially affect other baby food brands sold by them too?? When are you going to tell us anymore information on this?????????? You need to recall your milk, doesn't dissolve, my baby has been extremely upset, constipated and colicky since being on cow and gate, I bought 4 tubs as im paid monthly I don't have my receipt to return them and swap the brands! So my baby has obviously been eating this- you say to speak to a health care professional if they display any illness . Surely you as a company cook this food and seal the jars are accountable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, can you please provide us, the concerned consumer with exact details for the recall, not just that it 'may have been tampered with'. Why can’t we get any answers I have messaged nothing, my grandson has been ill for weeks now, couldn’t work out what it was not could the doctor.. Cow &Gate I am begging you please give us more info so we can either get help with some degree of info or stop worrying and be safe in the knowledge that our kids haven’t been poisoned, you are creating a panic.. I've just had a shop delivered from tesco, with every single one of these jars on and my baby has been eating them the past week. Can you please give more information? I purposely do online shopping as don't have time to go myself and do a big food shop. Very frustrating I’ve spoken to cow and gate today. And I fully understand that the info available is rather poor however the police investigation stops them saying more.\n",
      "If you child has become ill since having this get then to hospital as they will be able to find out more on the situation so they can help the child. And before anyone starts slating me. My own son has this and has had no issues. For all we know this could of happened a month ago and has been sat at the back of a warehouse and could well be none gone out. So instead of moaning on here about kids being ill take them to a&e. You won’t get a payout from them so why keep trying My baby has had 2 of these varieties and has had really loose nappies and high temperature. It’s not about the few pound that will be refunded it’s about knowing what risk our babies could potentially be in as ‘been tampered with’ is not enough information! I recently bought a jar of food which was either from boots or Tesco and this is what I nearly fed my daughter 🤮 luckily I tipped it into a bowl first! Can you confirm that you will put a clear statement out to explain what happened with the tampered jars once able to do so?\n",
      "15 weeks or so ago and literally no update of any information has been provided thus far! This is the 2nd time ive found a dirty black curly hair in food its disgusting i wont be ordering anything from here and the fact that ppl are tampering with baby food is shocking Can you please tell me why you are selli NG out of date baby milk at this time? I’ve just been up to Lloyd’s and purchased a baby milk to get home and find it went out of date last year Noticed in tesco they and now all wrapped with a seal so harder to tamper with Any update on this? It’s been 7 months and we still don’t know what our child ate... Cow and gate... do we yet have an update a year on? Is this any relation to the recall ??

      "/ .. Kirsty Lynn Murphy not sure if you have some from tesco xx It's been over a day and you still can't tell us how exactly they have been tampered with? All we want to know is what we've been feeding our children. You have potentially poisoned them and you can't do the decent thing and tell us what we need to know to protect and care for them. Safety is NOT your no 1 priority otherwise you'd be telling us!! Your covering your backs. It's disgraceful. I hope parents stop buying your products as I will be My son has been eating these jars from Tesco. I have spoken with yourselves and been told that it is being investigated with food standards & the police as to what may be the risk of these but no information can be given at this time - that is very concerning as a parent to not know or even be told what the concern/risk COULD be to babies consuming this. Very worrying! I hope there is an update soon & all babies who’ve consumed these items are ok! Very disappointing & concerning. Being told you cannot tell the exact reason at this time is not acceptable, you do not have the definitive results yet however concerned parents should at the very least be given an idea of what potential tampering may have occurred so they know whether to have their babies checked out & what to look out for. My son has eaten between 10-14 jars of cow and gate jarred 7month+ food bought from Tescos. He is poorly but the dr thinks it’s probably tonsillitis. Please get in touch with me to let me know what I need to be looking out for. Many thanks Holly Norman Anyone had an update or a call back???? Any update on this??? Can any more information be released yet. I did kit buy my jars from tesco but do not wish to use the ones I have for fear of the unknown patchy information that has been given out about why tesco recalled them as have lost all faith in cow and gate. I got some and my little one has been eating them but i cant remember where i got them from as i go into boots tesco and morrisons is there any way i can check where i got them from. In what way tempered with? I've gave my son this literally 2 hours ago? Is it just a precautionary measure or has it physically been tampered with? I just stocked up on these last week, glad my daughter has been ill so not eating over the last week!!!! We fed my grandson one of these last night!!!bought from Tesco!!what way have they been tampered with, need to know so can keep an eye out, will it make them ill???is there a way to know which ones batch date?we need more information Do you know what, I actually feel sorry for Cow & Gate UK! The reason they probably can’t tell you what to look for and what to tell health care professionals is because they probably don’t know what it is, not that they “don’t care” about people’s babies! They are a company providing for babies for god sake! I’m sure if they knew anything they would tell the public. Why isn’t anyone bombarding Tesco? If it’s just one retailer then it’s not been tampered with at the factory but at the retailer First they recalled the Heinz ones and now these ones ?🤦🏼‍♀️ I bought some from tesco and some from Asda and they're all mixed up? 🤷🏼‍♀️ So it’s just the most recent purchase? Because my husband has got an email yesterday from tesco about this, but he bought jars two days ago and also one week ago...can we use the ones from one week ago? So disappointing to find a brand that is supposed to care about the children it caters to hiding behind a company line. Direct message us they say so they can just repeat the same robotic patronising messages they’re issuing on here. Call us they say where they tell you they’ll put you on a priority callback list because your baby has experienced symptoms of illness since consuming one of these jars just so you can be ignored. The healthcare professionals they tell you to consult are bemused as to why they are being used as a point of reference when they can only treat what symptoms they are presented with as opposed to being able to tell them your baby is ill due to consumption of x. All this company care about is ensuring people do not stop purchasing their product from other suppliers. I would strongly suggest parents find alternative suppliers and brands that actually put babies first as opposed to this one!! So my frustration grows, the closest big shop is an hour away (Tesco, where I bought my other jars) went in today to return the jars I had and Tesco had absolutely nothing else suitable for my son all 10months+. I could cry. My boy started on the 7 month range from Tesco on Sunday. On Monday he started with a bad stomach - we’ve been having 9-10 full nappies in a day!! Doctors suspected food poisoning and sent a stool sample off for testing we are awaiting results. But doctors can’t treat for anything other than dehydration until the results are back. I phoned customer services to ask for more details but was told they couldn’t tell me anything. Surely if Cow & Gate UK are aware enough to recall these products you can share information with parents that have fed these jars to their baby? Any information for us would help the doctor with a diagnosis! What assurances can you give that this is isolated to product supplied to Tesco? I rang two hours ago and I’m still waiting for a phone call, my son ate this only yesterday... should I be worried? At the moment I’m very concerned... I’m not bothered about a refund .. just want to know what going on. I will never use cow and gate again the stress this has caused. I messaged on WhatsApp yesterday but it was out of hours. I was hoping that you might still pick this up and respond today??\n",
      "\n",
      "I also called and spoke with your customer services team yesterday evening and was promised a phone call back from the quality team but still waiting to hear anything!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell me why the 15 jars of your baby food if purchased at Tesco are being recalled? Should I be concerned? What if my baby has consumed some? What signs should I be looking for or worried about?? What was the tampering exactly??\n",
      "\n",
      "You need to divulge more details to your customers as a first time mum this is extremely concerning!! I have some of these in my cuboard but I buy from Asda and Tesco... how do I know if it’s a Tesco one??? Simply saying seek help from a healthcare professional, is not good enough. Healthcare professionals need to know what they are dealing with in order to treat any effects in a timely and appropriate manner. YOU are putting babies at further risk by withholding information potentially delaying treatment. We need to know how the product had been tampered with to identify if grizzly babies are grizzly because of teeth for eg or your product. We need more information. Stop passing the buck. I am being told on your lines you are inundated with calls. You're inundated as you won't provide information.\n",
      "\n",
      "My son has already consumed your product. What signs and symptoms do we need to look out for? Do not respond with your copied and pasted link to the food standards website, nor tell me to seek advice from a healthcare professional. From their response it seems that they might not ever tell us the cause of the recall. It should be law that they have too regardless of what they find. I’m amazed they can withhold such information when people have poorly babies and are worried sick. I’ve kept my jars and not taken them back and am having them tested myself so I know for sure if there’s anything wrong with the ones my child’s eaten. Although the fact they’re recalling jars from any date or batch from Tesco stores would make me assume this tampering could’ve been going on a while. I will not ever be buying cow and gate products again. So disappointed at the way they’ve handled this. Children’s health should be the most important thing. Not covering their own backsides and or possibly damaging an investigation. We deserve to know what our children may have potentially consumed. Doubt anyone will feed their child cow and gate after this, I wouldn’t even trust the jars from other shops either My little girl was sick last week she ate the last jar we got from tesco yesterday before seein this she's now been sick again.. An has a cough so probably just a virus but if it's to do with the jars what has it been tampered with what do I look out for she had 8 of these recalled jars last week I've just spoke to tesco and being advised to return and not use but my little boy has had one for lunch today (chicken havest)\n",
      "\n",
      "Tesco said potential tampering but couldnt give any more info. Is this something to worry about? We use all cow and gate from milk to jars to fruit pots. I know it says tesco but are Asda ones okay? My sons had diahorrea and was projectile vomiting after eating the garden pea and turkey one so definitley do not give your babies these. My son has allergies and it is hard enough finding foods never mind this I feel sick to the core. Been feeding my baby boy Cow & Gate 7+ months jars from Tesco at certain meal times and came across a very strange texture in one of the meals whilst checking for hot spots in the temperature (which I threw away)\n",
      "\n",
      "How do Cow & Gate expect parents not to panic and worry when they recall food and don’t give any added information as to what the problem is?!? I understand tests and investigations need to be carried out but this isn’t great being left to wonder and worry Alex I wonder if these jars had chunks of wood in like ours did. Glad to see they are actually doing something now rather than just fobbing people off with absolute bull**** like they did with us 🤬 x How can other stores not been effected\n",
      "Don’t it all get cooked in one big machine or do you have one designated for Tesco Asda etc.? All I’ve fed is my son cow and gate 7+ range for months all from Tesco!!! All you are doing is causing unnecessary worry and anxiety but not explaining further! Repeating the same generic message isn’t good enough I’m afraid! My sons been sick on and off for months have taken him to docs each time, not sure if it is related or not! Cow & Gate UK we’ve purchased these from Asda but your saying Tesco only sell them are these safe? I've got a load of them idk what I've got from asda and from tesco thow My god people are thick. It’s clearly a problem with products at Tesco. Cow and gate make mass products and sell them to a variety of retailers. If the problem was with cow and gate the products would be recalled from all stores, not just Tesco. They are not Tesco unique products. There is also a police investigation going on. This likely means that there is criminal intent. Product recalls don’t normally require police involvement. Chances are that there is some sort of ransom or malicious intent going on for gain. If I haven't got reciepts to prove I have bought the jars from tesco how can I prove I bought them from there? I'd bought these some of these jars before Xmas and when I opened the hake and courgette and also turkey and pea it looks like it had load of hairs in them so chucked them away. Thought I was going mad as noone else could see them and said was part of the food probably but had them before and never had that in them! Glad chucked them now What are the side effects because my son hasnt been him self for 2 days now (I normally make his meals myself but I had to buy 1 jar 2 days ago from tesco due to being out ) he now can't keep anything down every nappy is a dirty one and screaming like his in pain overly sleeping\n",
      "Defo taking him to the doctors tomorrow but I can't just say because of having one of your jars with out knowing what has actually happened to them Again this is a joke, and this is why neither of my children have eaten anything from a Jar, as you don't know what's in them, my youngest has just turned 6 months and this had to be the third or fourth time since she was born I've seen a recall, its ridiculous! Celia Gray just in case you have bought jars from Cow & Gate for Gordo from Tesco. These have been recalled for safety concerns. Is it just Tesco because I have them from Asda should I still use them Is it true the recall is for Tesco Serpentine Green in Peterborough only? This is what a member of staff just told me when i took back some jars just now? Thanks So the 4 month ones at Tesco are ok? Does this include Tesco sister stores one stop?? Parents and carers, please start making your own food for your little ones. It’s not worth it!!!! Ridiculous that I cant get any information to help my little one, knowing hes eat one of those listed. Whilst the lady on the phone was very pleasant, she just repeated the same messages as your generic replies on here are doing. You must have at least a random idea of what's happened. This is v anxiety provoking to all the mothers who just want to protect their children 😕. I have contacted Cow & gate uk twice this evening (5 hours ago the first time) and as my son had one of these jars on Sunday and has been poorly since Tuesday! I took him to the doctors Friday morning as he’s had a very upset stomach and they said it was probably gastroenteritis\n",
      "!! And now I have heard this since i am extremely worried these have made him poorly and would really appreciate someone calling me back with so more information! This is ridiculous! There are quite clearly mums/dads who are very concerned about what kind of exposures there are to their babies health me included, still not had a response from you and not getting answers! Being unable to provide more information isn't good enough! surely if someones baby is unwell because they had one of YOUR baby jars then more information would be helpful to try figure out a diagnosis/what the issue is..... I have fed my baby these jars since she has been weaned and this week alone she has eaten roughly 6 jars, I want more information as to what's going on. Shes also poorly so this worries me even more.\n",
      "Absolutely disgusted!! Stacey I know you won’t be buying Rosie 7 months stuff yet but making sure that Jamie’s gran or mum haven’t stocked up on them for future and are being recalled! Xxx My 7month old was hospitalised with severe diarrhoea and excessive blood in every stool. In short He is under three teams, surgical, gastro and the a paediatric team who are trying to figure out what is wrong. Has had extensive test so far and viruses,infecti\n",
      "ons ruled out amongst other conditions ruled out. The doctors cannot pin point the issue thus far. Now this has come to light and coincidentally he was put on to the potentially harmful jars three/four days prior to this starting. I’ve called cow and gate but not yet heard back along with the FSA as surely to help my baby, some information must be given to allow the doctors to treat correctly if this is indeed the cause. How can you treat something when the cause is not known. I await a response from cow and gate and will be taking this matter further due to the severity of my child’s condition Yes and after contacting Cow & Gate with our concerns as our child has eaten these products they just respond with same spiel that’s on Facebook and won’t give any further information regarding the nature of the contamination- so we will not be buying Cow & Gate products ever again and I would advise others to do so as they are more concerned with their corporate image and covering up what has happened than trying to reassure parents who’ve bought their products. My daughter has been sick and had diarrhoea since sunday night, she had eaten two of the jars that have been recalled on friday and saturday, i have contacted 111 as i am really concerned as she is not eating or having her milk she has a high temperature, she hasn't been around anyone with a sickness bug, her nappies are awful can you please advise inform whether these symptoms could be anything to do with the cow and gate food she has eaten I think it is so unfair that you are not advising of what symptoms to look out for and as to what is wrong with the product, I've left my daughter with these symptoms for 3 days now putting it down to a bug but she is still no better I am seeking medical advice Keep seeing the same reply’s over and over from cowgate I personally think every parent on here deserves a explanation to what it may be contaminated with but there just saying the same answer if parents ect are putting our trust in you to provide safe products for our children then we should be told the answer why these products are being recalled many parents are worried and I am my self and I for one would like a valid answer not the same old ones yous have been repeating over and over I would just take any bk as was put on 5 mins ago so could be any sent to stores In past week to 2 weeks Can you return 1/2 used jars my daughter only eats 1/2 a jar 🙄 and switches 1 for dinner one for tea so I have 3 opened jars!!\n",
      "My daughter had been so unsettled the last week and starting to wonder if this is the reason! Shannon Barthorpe I know he isn't old enough yet but you're usually prepared so not sure if you have any in xx Yeah I called up for more info and got NOTHING. What exactly does tampering with mean?? My little girl never has jars!! And typically she’s had 2 this week. Won’t be having any anymore after this. And the total lack of care for telling the parents what’s actually wrong with them is shocking. I got told on the phone it was an on going investigation and that was it. I have these jars from Asda and Boots are they safe? Anyone had any update yet?? Has anyone had any answers yet? 🤔😔 Has anyone else been contacted by news reporters?? My daughter has aten half a jar and she is only 4 months! If she so much as get ill or anything i will not be happy! 😡 she had the butternut squash and salmon I gave my daughter half a jar yesterday afternoon and from 4 o’clock onwards she done nothing but b sick everywhere to the point I had to take her doctors she seems ok today but still not her normal happy self Please elaborate on what they’ve been tampered with my 7 month old son has eaten this for lunch ever day this week latest being yesterday at his grandmother! Not enough information , what have they been tampered with ? How I’ll can it make them? What signs do we need to be looking out for ? Thats the reason why i never give my kid cow and gate! 😡😡😡 this is not first time recalled the product! I rather spend little bit more to other brand! Its was AWFUL! Unacceptable!😡😡😡 What do you mean by \"unwell\"? FFS Cow & Gate. You've got anxious parents here (myself included) now is not the time to be vague. My LO had a jar last night. What is going on???! Oh great what about the jars my son has already eaten that I bought this week?? Won't bloody get a refund on them and would help if I was to know what to look out for! Glad I only bought another 1 today so it can go back.. Sarah not sure if Dougie has any? X Why can’t you at the very least advise the parents of any symptoms they should be looking out for? A bit late in informing us. I purchased these on 21 January. The baby has eaten them by now. He had diarrhoea the day after but put it down to teething. What’s the next step? I got mine from morrisons? Any more information yet? Which ones are effected?! As have been told all now Cow & Gate UK it is clear from the comments it is in the public interest for you to give full disclosure, clearly there is reasonable evidence to recall and risk distress of customers in doing so, so share it please - not to compromise any investigation but more importantly to ensure the safety and well-being of our children. As parents, we will naturally think the worst without specific information to alleviate concerns, it is irresponsible not to share what you know now - as freely as you advertise products for sale. As for this cottage industry of private messaging those who have raised concern, get a grip and notify the public with the same blanket approach you have given in your insensitive recall notice. The trust in your brand is shot in my household. Rachael Armstrong If Cow and Gate don't care enough about their customers enough to tell us how their products may harm our children then we should all just stop using them! Yes we all realise this is not their fault but they need to be open and honest when it comes to our children's health! Disgusting do you’s hot quality control on the job should of been checked before the get sent to shops, this is baby food man. Either someone tried to blackmail cow and gate or the animal rights mob are at it again. Omg!!! Only just seen it now!?!! My girls have been eating this everyday including today!!!!!! I need to make a formal complaint!?? How dare you make our babies at risk and not us what exactly happened? I certainly wont be buying cow and gate n e more will using a different brand!!! What happens if we have already fed these foods to our baby? Are they likely to make them ill? Are jars bought in other supermarkets ok? just blend up your own food if necessary, you won't have this problem or co carbs with anything that may be added. Alternatively cook a carrot/\n",
      "broccoli etc. endless possibilities. There has to be an update soon.. I am no longer using cow and gate as I have no trust in them... Real shame but not a major issue for me as there are many brands out there... Am sure am not alone... Cow and gate management must realise they are losing custom via their lack of transparency in this.. Blue rubber has been found in jars Nearly 2 weeks and you still cant give us anymore information? Cow and gate are a joke I've purchased a load of your 4-6 jars ready for weaning and tbh I am tempted to chuck them all in the bin seeing the amount of issues with all your food and no awnsers to what is the issue This really worried me because my baby eats these all the time, and for the last 6 weeks he has had a bad tummy and keeps getting sent home from nursery. He rejects cow and gate jars completely now. Should I worry? Andrea it's just been on the news cow and Gate are not giving any information out What are the batch codes? Can anyone message me plz with symptoms if ur wee one is ill plz mines is too who is also been eating these for ages my doctor cant determine if it is related if we dont know how the jars have been tampered been to doctors twice now and got to go back today so would like to hear what other wee ones symptoms are to see if its similar or the same plz thank u xxxx How exactly have they been tampered with?? Yes in what way has this been tampered with ???? Explain ? What actually happened with this? We’ve had no updates on the investigation? Cow & Gate Please advise what you do if you have a cupboard full of these jars and can’t differentiate which shop which jars came from??? Angela Footer only just bloody brought them too this happens like every other week! Is this same for Northern Ireland? Kerry Garnham Kourtney Leaa Eli Christodoulides Yvette Armstrong Colin Roe Abbie Beecham Laura Booth My baby was always fussy trying to get her to eat these dinners, never an issue with homemade or Ella's kitchen which is the other brand we used, what potentially has my daughter been exposed to? I know its precautionary but it doesn't sit well with me after I've been feeding my daughter these.\n",

I have whatsapped your page but no reply, I brought mine from MORRISONS - it had PLASTIC pieces in 2 jars! A simple refund is not good enough!!! I will not buy a single product from cow & gate ever again. I doubt anyone posting will either! You have probably used them now.... Where do you stand now? X Do you need a receipt to prove they were purchased in Tesco? My baby has been ill since her jar last night 😩 Looks like there is going to be loads of worried parents contacting drs, 111, and A+E departments if their babies are sick. Please tell these parents if the \"tampering\" is likely to harm their babies and if so in what way. I honestly think the police would had released a statement by now as to whether babies are at risk. It's shocking the way this has been handled by cow and gate. Bog off with all your copied and pasted bot replies. The parents on here have a right to know and more than 24 hours later it's shocking that they still don't know if there babies are at risk. There must be some information on this?! I’ve fed my child a few of these and now I need to know what to look out for? Is it disease or foreign bodies I’m looking for?

      "I used, swing-pop bottle, wine bottle, screw cap bottle, wide-mouth bottle and even one-time plastic bottle. So what have I found out?\n",
      "\n",
      "Swing-pop bottle. ... probably the most commonly used one for many brewers, they gave really good pressure and create the fizz you might be after. They can be easily available on Amazon, Ikea and even daiso. I didn’t try those from amazon, I didn’t want to pay for shipping or fancy bottles. Unless you are a seasoned brewer and what to experience all types otherwise there are cheaper and much easily available bottles. Daiso carries swing-pop bottles too but their grade is probably just good for bottle water or juice. They are very thin so I am afraid a good fermented will shatter the bottle with the gas built up. There is a mixed feeling of using Ikea bottles, some brewer said they shatter but I had never experienced that myself. I believe not because they fermentation was extremely successful that it will send the bottle to explosion. Rather, did they put too much fruits and the sugar created overly fizz? Or did they left some gaps for the gas to fill up, just imagine your mouth is filled with water and I just keep pumping more water into you mouth, so matter how much water you can hold, somehow it will still leak or burst right... or maybe they just simply didn’t do a daily test for their 2F. I couldn’t stress how important this need to be done diligently! One disadvantage of using this swing pop bottle is how narrow and how hard to wash those bottle. (I shared on another post on how to wash those bottle, read if you are keen). And they can be highly explosive dangerous! Do not attempt to shake them!\n",
      "\n",
      "Wide- mouth bottle. ... they are also easily available - as usual from Amazon, Ikea and Diaso. Or simply recycle from your pasta bottles, Peanut butter bottles etc. Putting old mason jar to good use, however, as there is not pressure build up (the narrow neck), gas has difficulty building up. Is likely you going to have flat and non-gassy kombucha using this type of glass. One advantage using this type of glass, it’s really easy to wash. I personally do not recommend using this method for 2F, but they are good for growing and storing scoby. I like the handle bottle (the white bottle in the picture), they make transporting scoby so easily.\n",
      "\n",
      "Screw top glass bottle. ... I had also recycled my honey bottles, enzyme bottles, they are safe to use and does gave a good reasonable fizz build up. They have shorter neck. One disadvantage using this type of bottle is the plastic screw can expand and somehow gave way by the pressure. When you tried placing them laying flat in the fridge, they will leak. If you can find those with metal screw bottle - from storing distilled water, sparkling water, they are a good option. They resolved the problem of a plastic screw top. And dun expect them to give you good carbonation. I found the screw cap gave me lesser carbonation compared to swing-pop.\n",
      "\n",
      "One-time plastic bottle. ... this isn’t the most ideal type of bottle. Those plastic bottles, like the kind that bottled distilled/ mineral water and soft drinks can easily be obtained and used to store kombucha if the screw tops screw on tightly. But, after all it’s an one time bottle, recycling them, even food-grade plastic, may contain undesirable chemicals that can leach into the kombucha. We never do test right so we don’t know any possible side effect or possible bottle bomb. I wouldn’t use it for second fermentation as yeasts are still working in the bottle, I would used it as re-bottling after second fermentation, so that transporting the drink is much more easily and much safer for handling. It’s doesn’t break when you drop it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wine bottle. ... one of my favorite has to be wine bottle. And the more you drink, the more supply of empty wine bottles you will have. They worked similar to swing top + screw cap bottles. And their bottles (especially red wine bottles) tend to be tinted. Making it’s a good shield from direct sunlight. And they are usually good graded bottles. Except their screw top may rust or dent over time.\n",

To be honest, miss 7 month old Hailee loves ALL the flavors no lie, she has all of them and not 1 has she disliked. She easily eats a whole pouch or a whole jar in one go of any and all flavors 😍😁🤭👌👶 There are so many flavours my baby girl loves. The berry nice pear she loves. Also the apple blueberry and kumara. My 8 month year old son loves the banana and apple porridge 🙂 will eat the whole pouch for breakfast! Pear apple and banana brings every day for my lil one this flavor is her most favorite.

His formula just wasn’t cutting it for him 😂😂❤️❤️ Chicken and veg risotto jar is my girl favourite, but I like to through her a bit with the tuna one My kids both love the smoothie pouches! My boy is only 3.5 months but I bought some of the pear banana and apple for him to try in a few weeks (got to be prepared) love that it is 4-6 months because he is solely breastfed and is a big hungry boy that I feel is going to eat lots when he’s older !

      "Hallo,\n",
      "\n",
      "teilweise bin ich überrascht, teilweise amüsiert, wenn ich lese wie hier fast verfeindete Guppen beim Futter alles Mögliche\n",
      "verteidigen, rechtfertigen , im günstigsten Fall erklären wollen, oder einfach nur behaupten.\n",
      "Dabei wäre es bei manchen Sachen so einfach den gesunden Menschenverstand einzuschalten und nachzudenken, mit unter das noch\n",
      "mit ein bischen Logik zu verbinden.\n",
      "Ist Vitamin C aus der Orange das Gleiche wie Vitamin C aus der Zitrone oder Hagebutte ????\n",
      "Natürlich Vitamin C ist Vitamin C , egal woher er stammt. Allerdings gilt das nicht ganz für synthetisch hergestellte Stoffe.\n",
      "Jeder Diabetiker weiß, dass ihm Insulin zwar hilft, das er , wenn er spritzen muß langfristig mit Schäden rechnen muß, weil\n",
      "hergestelltes Insulin eben nicht so perfekt paßt wie eigenes. Früher oder später macht es sich bei den Gefäßen bemerkbar, oft zuerst\n",
      "bei den Augen. Also noch einmal : Vitamin C ist und bleibt C wenn es aus einer natürlichen Quelle stammt- synthetisch zB. als\n",
      "Nahrungsergänzung ist da etwas problematischer. Und auch Eisen bleibt Eisen.\n",
      "Von einigen Sonderformen, bei denen noch die räumliche Anordnung des Moleküls eine Rolle spielt, will ich nicht eingehen. Wir kennen\n",
      "das alle zB. als rechts- und linksdrehender Zucker bzw. beim Süßstoff.\n",
      "Aber die lassen wir mals außen vor.\n",
      "Also Arginin bleibt Arginin, egal ob es aus Fischmehl, Blutmehl, Weizen oder sonst woher stammt. Damit ist der Streit um einzelne\n",
      "Stoffe komplett daneben. Auch Valin aus Getreide oder Sojaschrot oder sonstwas ist und bleibt Valin. Einzelne Zutaten sind also\n",
      "per se nicht schlechter wie andere. An dieser Stelle ist die Diskussion über den Wert verschiedener Zutaten absolut obsolet.\n",
      "Aber auch hier gilt synthetisch hergestellte Aminosäuren sind nicht ganz gleichwertig.\n",
      "Wenn hier alles zu Ende wäre, wäre alles gut und schön.\n",
      "Also ich habe Soja, da ist doch schon einiges drin. Tja jetzt muß das aber in meinen Organismus. Und hier ist die erste Klippe.\n",
      "Spinat enthält bekanntlich Eisen. Das wäre schon mal gesund. Das Problem : Der menschliche Organismus kann das Eisen nur\n",
      "unzureichend aufnehmen, weil es mit der Oxalsäure einen Komplex bildet, den der Körper nicht aufnehmen kann. Deshalb habe ich\n",
      "mit Absicht die Überschrift gewählt. Spinat als Eisenlieferant ist daher obsolet. Wenn ich ihn jetzt für gesund erkläre weil\n",
      "er Eisen enthält, ist zwar richtig, dass das Eisen vorhanden ist, es kann aber nicht verwertet werden, deshalb ist er ein\n",
      "miserabler Eisenspender. Nun haben aber viele Lebewesen unterschiedliche Verdauungen : So kann die Kuh mit ihren mehreren\n",
      "Mägen und der Wiederkauertechnik Sachen verdauen, die bei uns sicher wieder unverdaut raus kämen.\n",
      "Der Koi hat keinen Magen, auch hier gestaltet sich die Verdauung komplett anders.\n",
      "Es nützt mir also Blutmehl nix, auch wenn die Einzelanalyse den Eindruck erweckt, es wäre perfekt, wenn der Organismus, der es\n",
      "aufnehmen soll es gar nicht aufnehmen kann.\n",
      "So wird Sojaschrot vom Karpfen nur zu 40 % aufgenommen, damit vermindert sich natürlich auch die Aufnahme der wichtigen Bestandteile\n",
      "ensprechend, und obwohl die Einzelanalyse perfekt erscheint, laufe ich in eine Mangelernährung.\n",
      "Es genügt also nicht die Einzelanalyse zu betrachten und dann zu glauben das sei es - und dann erbittert dafür zu kämpfen - sondern\n",
      "der nächste Schritt ist die Verdaulichkeit und die Art der Aufnahme durch den Organismus. Damit fällt Manches was vielversprechend\n",
      "aussieht hinten runter. Also nocheinmal Blutmehl per se ist weder gut noch schlecht, es muß dann erst mal eruiert werden, ob\n",
      "es für den Organismus an den ich das verfüttern will geeignet ist. Kann er es überhaupt aufnehmen, und wie kann er es verwerten.\n",
      "Man erinnere sich an den Spinat.\n",
      "Dann jede Art auf der Welt hat seine eigenen Aminosäuresequenzen. Das heißt die Art und die Menge der Aminosäuren in einem\n",
      "Menschenmuskel ist ganz anders wie in einem Karpfenmuskel. Wäre für die Kripo schlimm wenn das nicht so wäre , sonst könnte sie\n",
      "nicht einmal unterscheiden ob das Schwein oder der Bauer geschlachtet wurde.\n",
      "Dabei hat der Muskel - der steht für gesundes Wachstum, deshalb beschränke ich mich hier auf den - in seiner kleinsten Baueinheit\n",
      "ein für die Art typisches Aminosäurenmuster. Da er nur die nichtessentillen Aminosäuren synthetisieren kann, müssen die\n",
      "essentiellen - daher auch der Name - durch die Nahrung zugeführt werden. Der Organismus braucht also die richtige Menge essentieller\n",
      "und nicht essentieller Aminosäuren um einen Muskel aufzubauen. Aber die braucht er nicht nur als groben Haufen, sondern in der\n",
      "ausreichenden Menge und im richtigen Mengenverhältnis.\n",
      "Hier ein einfaches Beispiel : nehmen wir an er hätte die Sequenz AABCCC . Dann nützt es wenig wenn wir von jeder Sorte gleich viel\n",
      "hätten, denn dann wäre C der begrenzende Faktor. Wir brauchen also nicht E nich F sondern ausschließlich A, B und C im Verhältnis\n",
      "2:1:3 , sonst wird es nicht optimal. Das ist die sog. Liebig´sche Faßtheorie.\n",
      "Also nochmals : Ich brauche Art spezifisch die notwendigen Aminosäuren in der richtigen Relation zueinander. Und genau das sollte\n",
      "im Idealfall als Nahrung zugeführt und durch die Verdauung aufgenommen werde. Euer tapfer verteidigtes Blutmehl oder Soja nützt\n",
      "mir wenig, wenn es a. nicht ausreichend durch die Verdauung aufgenommen wird und b. die notwenidgen AS nicht komplett enthält ,\n",
      "und c. das noch im richtigen Mengenverhältnis.\n",
      "Nun sagt uns aber der gesunde Menschenverstand : Nichts ist dem Karpfen ähnlicher wie der Karpfen.\n",
      "Das heißt ideal wäre geschredderter Karpfen, denn da beide identisch sind, haben auch beide identische Muskelaufbauten. Das geht aber\n",
      "nicht und wird hoffentlich nicht gemacht, aber man greift dann auf die Verwandschaft zurück, denn die hat wenigstens noch eine\n",
      "weitgehende Übereinstimmung : und das ist das Fischmehl. Nun ist Fischmehl nicht ganz billig, als versucht man auf andere Stoffe\n",
      "auszuweichen. Dass aber Sojaextraktionsschrot weniger Verwandtschaft mit einem Karpfenmuskel hat, als Mehl von der Gattung Fisch,\n",
      "na ja da wäre wieder der Einsatz von dem gesunden Menschenverstand.\n",
      "Natürlich kann ich versuchen x Komponenten irgenwie so zu mischen, dass die Zusammensetzung ähnlich ist, das klingt im Labor gut,\n",
      "aber wenn sich dann rausstellt , dass eine Komponente weiner erdachten Mischung nur zu 40 % resorbiert wird, die andere zu 73\n",
      "und das dann noch von der Wassertemperatur , Sauerstoff, Darmbakterien etc. zusammenhängt, dann Mahlzeit ......\n",
      "Das zeigt aber wie sinnlos teilweise die erbittert geführten Diskussionen sind, denn sie klammern die wichtigen Punkte aus\n",
      "konzentrieren sich auf irgendeine Laboranalyse und erklären die für heilig.\n",
      "Hinzukommt, dass man dem Futter ja die Qualität nicht ansieht. Allein beim Fischmehl gibt es Klasse I bis IV.\n",
      "Klasse I halte ich für komplett unbrauchbar, der Markt offensichtlich auch, denn das drückt er im Preis aus. Gibt es irgendein Futter\n",
      "das die Klasse des Fischmehls angibt ??? Und jeder sagt ein tolles Futter , enthält Fischmehl. Ist es Klasse I dann ist mir\n",
      "Soja noch lieber, obwohl ich bekanntermaßen ein Sojagegener bin ( aus verschiedenen Gründen ).\n",
      "Also bei den Deklarationen ist es gar nicht oder nur sehr schwer möglich überhaupt ein Futter zu beurteilen.\n",
      "Schon gar nicht auch daran ob es Wasser verfärbt oder einen leichten Ölfilm hat.\n",
      "Brennessel mag keine schlechte Zutat sein, aber sie färbt definitiv das Wasser braun. Nun ist die Frage sind mir gesunde Koi\n",
      "leicht braunes Wasser wert ???? Das zeigt schon wie absurd so eine Diskussion sein kann. Und die Pellets werden mit bis zu\n",
      "130 Grad Celsius durch den Extruder gejagt, da kann ich auch M;otorenöl nehmen. Die essentiellen Fettsäuren , die der Karpfen brauch\n",
      "( Omega Fettsäuren ) sind bei der Temperatur alle tot, wenn nicht sogar die Maillardreaktion stattgefunden hat. Also macht es nur Sinn\n",
      "das Öl danach aufzubringen. Will ich aber die für die Ernährung wichtigen 10 % oder mehr erreichen habe ich immer einen Fettfilm.\n",
      "Da ändert auch Vakuum und anderer Schnickschnack nix .Ältere unter uns können sich vielleicht noch an das Futter Koi´s Best\n",
      "erinnern, das hatte eine Ölfilm wie ein Tanker, aber der hatte als erster diese Problematik erkannt. Leider ist er verunglückt\n",
      "und das Futter verschwand vom Markt. All diesen Unsinn ob Knoblauch oder Stevia - nix als ein Lockstoff - , Aloe Vera etc.\n",
      "drin ist ist purer Unsinn, den Aloe Vera noch Knoblauch bauen Eiweiß im Koikörper auf. Der braucht einfach die richtigen\n",
      "Eiweiß-, KH.- und Fettrationen und lt. einigen Herstellern unbedingt Micronährstoffe , damit es ein Prachtkerl wird.\n",
      "Dabei ist das mit den Mikronährstoffen, der beste Werbegag, den ich jeh gehört habe, denn es ist nur ein anderer Name für\n",
      "Vitamine, Mineralien und Spurenelementen. Die hat jedes Futter, die guten in der richtigen Dosierung.\n",
      "Wie gesagt schön, zu beobachten wenneiner auf den anderen einhackt und einen Kreuzzug für eine bestimmte Zutat führt, und dabei - wie heißt es so schön : _\n",
      "den Blick für ´s große Ganze verliert . Aber für Klein Fritzchen ist die Welt mitunter sehr einfach und die Futterherstellung\n",
      "sowieso.\n",
      "Als nächstes werde ich noch ein paar Zeilen über Wasserfarben bzw. Wasserverfärbungen loslassen. Bis dahin Knüppel raus und\n",
      "alles hier zurechtstutzen. Für die ganz Genauen und Schlauen : Manches wurde nur an Beispielen erklärt, die AS A, B, C gibt\n",
      "es in Wirklichkeit nicht, es sind Metaphern.\n",
      "\n",
      "In diesem Sinne weniger Futterneid\n",

      "nicht so verkehrt sein, oder es sind die Fische !!?? oder das Herrchen ??? Und manches Futter ist mit 1 % vom Fischgewicht\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Grundsätzlich, indem Sie ein gutes Futter verwenden. Hiervon brauchen Sie in der Regel weniger als von sogenannten leeren Pellets oder gar Flocken. Das liegt daran, dass in der Fischzucht beim Futter ein wichtiger Parameter der energetische Bedarf beim Koi ca. 40 - 70 KJ/kg in der Mast 230 - 270 kJ/kg ist. Und je höher der Wert bei dem gekauften Futter, desto weniger muß ich mengenmäßig füttern, damit der Fisch trotzdem auf den für ihn notwendigen Wert kommt. Daneben hat ein gutes Futter wenig Feuchtigkeit und damit Wasser.\n",
      "Und für Wasser zu bezahlen, ist bei einem Teich, mehr wie sinnlos. Auch hat ein gutes Futter einen höheren Grad an Verwertung. Das heißt konkret weniger Ausscheidungen. Da nur das dem Fisch nutzt, was in ihm drin bleibt, sind Ausscheidungen verschwendetes Geld. Hier ist allerdings Vorsicht geboten, denn das ist nicht so einfach eruierbar.\n",
      "Auch hohe Nitritwerte sind Ausscheidungen die Geld kosten, aber nicht sichtbar sind .\n",
      "Auch der eine oder andere Schnickschnack von Aloe Vera bis Xylit verteuert ein Futter in sinnloser Weise . Meist ist es in so geringer Konzentration drin, dass nur der Glaube hilft . Und so allgemeine Floskeln \"auf Grund langer und umfangreicher Forschungen ....\" sind schön zu lesen, bringen aber nix, wenn keine Datenquelle angegeben wird. Dann sind es einfach nur Wünsche.\n",
      "Nur Daten schaffen Fakten. Und haben Sie sich schon mal gefragt, wer so doof sein könnte ein Menge Geld zu verbrennen, um für eine Minigruppe irgendwelche Versuchsreihen zu testen. Und die Aquakultur forscht wenig beim Karpfen und mit anderer Zielrichtung . Und wenn zB. Aloe Vera im medizinischen Bereich umfangreich getestet wurde , mit dem Ergebnis, es sei als Abführmittel geeignet, und genau das soll nun in verschwindend geringer Dosierung an anderer Stelle Wunder vollbringen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dabei wird ein eintretender Gewöhnungsfaktor durch die Dauerdosierung gar nicht beachtet . Und sollten Sie wider Erwarten einen Blick in eine solche Arbeit, die das belegen soll werfen, ist entweder die Versuchsanordnung seltsam oder der Auftraggeber nicht ohne Eigeninteresse .

      "Und für einen Koi ist das beste Lockmittel ein anständiges für ihn geeignetes Eiweiß, so wie es die Naturnahrung bietet. Seien Sie figurbetont und nehmen Sie\n",
      "Stevia für Ihren Tee, das macht Sinn .\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Füttern Sie angemessen. Kein Koi ist in einem Teich verhungert, aber falsche Fütterung hat schon vielen das Leben gekostet. Schmeißen Sie nicht wahllos Futter in den Teich . Der Koi hat keinen Magen und damit kein Sättigungsgefühl.\n",
      "Der würde fressen bis es hinten wieder erscheint. Füttern Sie auch nicht nach so komischen Regeln was die Koi in 5 Minuten vertilgen. Das ist viel zu ungenau und von viel zu viel Variablen abhängig. Vergessen Sie nicht, dass mehrere Parameter bei der Fütterung eine Rolle spielen. Füttern Sie nur der Jahreszeit entsprechend, beachten Sie die herrschende Sauerstoffsättigung im Teich . Temperatur, Sauerstoffgehalt, das sind Parameter, die wichtig für die Nahrungsaufnahme und den Stoffwechsel sind. Bedenken Sie , dass ein Karpfen zwar sehr häufig gründelt, aber er dabei einzelne Insekten etc. findet und nicht Unmengen an Pellets. Und vergessen Sie nicht : ein Mensch braucht schon fast ein Drittel der Nahrung um seine Körpertemperatur zu halten. Dieser Futter- und Energieaufwand entfällt beim Koi, der paßt sich an. Und es sollte immer nur einer füttern, und nicht jeder der gerade am Teich vorbei geht.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Machen Sie sich frei von dem immer-größer-Wahn. Ein Fisch hat genetisch ein bestimmtes Wachstumspotential , das man durch das Futter unterstützen kann. Ein Fisch mit Potential 60 cm, wird nie 90, und wenn Sie noch so füttern. Er würde dadurch nur fett.\n",
      "Warum muß ein Tossai 40 cm haben, es ist kein Wachstumswettlauf. Geben Sie dem Tier Zeit sich entsprechend seiner genetischen Vorgaben artgerecht optimal zu entwickeln . Sie wollen doch einen quicklebendigen gesunden Fisch und nicht ein Fettmonster. Sie ersparen sich so manche Enttäuschung, denn ist er als Tosai schon 40, hat aber nur das Potential bis 60 , wird es Sie frustrieren, wenn er die nächsten 5 Jahre nur 20 cm wächst.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Optimieren Sie die Futterbeschaffung. Es ist wenig optimal jeden Tag eine neue 1 kg Packung zu öffnen. Schätzen Sie Ihren Futterbedarf und kaufen eine Menge, bei der sich der Mengenrabatt auswirkt. Allerdings sollten Sie dann über entsprechende Lagermöglichkeiten verfügen , heißt gleichmäßig kühl - 6 - 10 Grad - , dunkel und trocken . Geht nicht ? Sicher kennen Sie andere Koifans .

Der Zweck und die Zielrichtung eines solchen Futters ist eine ganz andere . Und wer glaubt Kostenoptimierung in dem Bereich würde nicht zu Kompromissen führen, hält die Erde sicher noch für eine Scheibe . Das erzwingt schon der Kostendruck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sparen Sie lieber beim Partner, es muß nicht immer ein Brilliant sein, auch schön geschliffenes Glas hat was . Und was haben Sie davon ? Verwöhnen Sie Ihren Koi, der wird Ihnen nie widersprechen und immer dankbar sein, wenn Sie mit der Futterdose am Teich auftauchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir wünschen Ihnen viel Spaß mit Ihren Koi und hoffen Sie können die Anregungen nutzen.\n",

      "\n",
      "warum diese provokante Überschrift ?\n",
      "Ich will versuchen im Folgenden eine Begründung dafür zu liefern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fangen wir einfach an :\n",
      "\n",
      "Mikrostoffe\n",
      "\n",
      "Wenn ich mich hinstellen würde und sagen würde hey ich bin was Besonderes ich habe Zellen, würde sich jeder an den Kopf fassen und an meinem Verstand\n",
      "zweifeln. In der Ernährung werden die Stoffe in Makronährstoffe und Mikronährstoffe eingeteilt. Makronährstoffe sind Eiweiß, Fett, Kohlehydrate, Mikronährstoffe sind definitionssgemäß Mineralien, Vitamine usw. . Also sind Mikronährstoffe was Besonderes ?? Keineswegs selbst das größte Schrottfutter hat Mikronährstoffe .\n",
      "Genausowenig wie ich was Besonderes bin , hat jeder von Euch Zellen und entweder sind wir alle normal oder alle was Besonderes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stevia , der Supersüßstoff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Das mag praktisch sein, steht eine Diät an. Aber wollen Sie Ihren Koi füttern, damit er abnimmt ?? Wenn ja sollten Sie sich erst mal erkundigen, ob der Koi\n",
      "Stevia aufnehmen kann , und wenn ja , wie er Stevia verstoffwechselt. Das sollten Sie dann in Relation zu anderen vergleichbaren Stoffen in Relation setzen, um zu ergründen,ob Stevia ein sogenanntes Superfood ist. Und Sie glauben das hat jemals einer gemacht ???\n",
      "Wozu auch, was soll der Koi abspecken ?? Und was soll es helfen , wenn Sie Ihre Fische grundsätzlich überfüttern.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hier zeigt sich schon die Problematik all´dieser Behauptungen: Man weiß gar nicht kann der Koi das überhaupt über den Darm aufnehmen, und wenn ja in welchem Umfang überhaupt ? Soja mag noch so ein gutes Aminosäurenprofil haben, aber der Koi kann es nur zu 60 % aufnehmen, und das nur ungleichmäßig.\n",
      "Man wird kaum Evolution beeinflussen können. Was heißt das ? Der Karpfen war und ist immer schon ein Fisch in einem Teich. Naturgemäß hat er sich im Laufe der Evolution perfekt an seinen Lebensraum angepasst . Selten sieht man im Teich aber Stevia !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Knoblauch\n",
      "\n",
      ", was soll er bringen? Auch beim Menschen gibt es keine wesentlichen Wirkungen. Ich höre förmlich die Aufschreie, aber Untersuchungsergebnisse zeigen nichts anderes, und Untersuchungen enden oft mit dem Satz:\"wenn es einen Effekt geben sollte, setzt das eine regelmäßige Gabe über sehr lange Zeit voraus. Er soll blutdrucksenkend wirken . Leidet Ihr Koi an hohem Blutdruck ??\n",
      "\n",
      "Das gilt leider auch für zahllose andere Substanzen. Oft zeigt sich auch bei näherem Hinsehen das manches Superfood schlechter ist wie unser Brokkoli. Rennen Sie in den Laden und tanzen um den Brokkoli, weil es ein europäisches Superfood ist? Sicher nicht, denn man weiß , dass es zahlreiche gesunde Nahrungsmittel gibt , aber das ist kein Superfood. Dazu müßte das Nahrungsmittel etwas haben oder können, was durch kein anderes Lebensmittel erreichbar ist. Nehmen wir die\n",

      "sie hat angeblich soviel Vitamine und Mineralien. Die Pestizide und das Nikotin werden geflissentlich übersehen. Aber hier wird schon getrickst : Man vergleicht\n",
      "ein getrocknetes Pulver mit einer frischen Frucht oder Gemüse. Natürlich hat Moring mehr Kalium als Bananen. Aber Bananenpulver !!!! übertrifft Moringa bei weitem. Dann wird bei Vitamin C die Blätter am Baum gewertet und locker verschwiegen, dass durch Trocknung und Aufbereitung nichts mehr übrig bleibt.\n",
      "Acerolapulver hat das 600 Fache !!!! an Vitamin C. usw. . Es werden also Äpfel mit Birnen verglichen.\n",
      "Im übrigen wären bei uns dann Äpfel, Grünkohl, Heidelbeere usw. genauso Superfood. Merken Sie was !!??\n",
      "\n",
      "Aloe Vera\n",
      "\n",
      "soll helfen gegen Herpes genitalis, Psoriasis, Neurodermitis, Diabetes, Cholesterin senken. Leider hatte bis heute keiner meiner Koi so etwas, also warte ich weiter auf den Einsatz. Knoblauch wirkt blutdrucksenkend. Auch bisher hatte ich noch keinen hypertonen Koi. Schade . So muß ich ihn immer bevor er zum Einsatz kommen kann ins Essen als Gewürz vermanschen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granberries\n",
      "\n",
      "sind gegen Harnwegsinfektionen, entwässernd !!!! meine Koi lachen schon . Getrocknete Cranberries enthalten übrigens nach dem Verarbeitungsvorgang kein Vitamin C oder A mehr.\n",
      "Also bleiben Sie kritisch und arbeiten mit Ihrem gesunden Menschenverstand. Und Fragen hilft oft der Wahrheit näher zu kommen. Fragen Sie den Händler : Was bewirkt xy beim Koi, wer hat das unersucht, wo finde ich seriöse Informationen, wie lange weiß man das schon usw. und bilden sich selbst eine Meinung.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drücken wir es drastisch aus ; Essen Sie gern Mäuse, wühlen gern im Kot oder schmecken Ihnen Spinnen ?\n",
      "Die Katze, die Fliege und der Spatz sehen das ganz anders,\n",
      "\n",
      "Es gibt kein Superfood, es gibt Nahrungsmittel die das eine oder andere in mehr oder weniger großem Umfang enthalten, doch ist das nicht Super oder gar ein Allheilmittel, Der Körper ist auf eine umfassende Ernährung angewiesen, die all´ seine Bedürfnisse befriedigen. Dabei ist er ein Allesfresser ähnlich wie\n",
      "der Karpfen. Also ernähren Sie sich und Ihren Karpfen ausgewogen und nicht defizitär oder super.\n",
      "Und noch eine Randbemerkung : Und sollten Sie jemals ein Superfood finden, Sie werden nie wissen ob Ihr Koi dadurch schöner und länger lebt, denn BHT, Rückstände von Glyphosat im Mais und Soja werden ihn durch einen Tumor vorher umbringen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Es werden Spuren von angeblichem Superfood zugegeben , doch bei Stoffen wie BHT ,die nachweislich Tumoren hervorrufen, ist man nicht zimperlich , welche Blasphemie .\n",
      "Und jetzt a Schnapserl, das enzianische Superfood, und die Leber, die wächst nach ...............\n",
      "\n",
      "Gäbe es ein Superfood, jeder Hersteller wäre ein Idiot, wenn er diese Vorteile nicht nützen würde, denn noch gilt Knolauch, curcuma ... für alle,\n",
      "\n",
      "Noch ein paar Worte zu anderen Angaben auf dem Label : Sind Chips aus Korea oden den USA schlechter wie made in Germany ? Das ist natürlich Quatsch . Und Futter aus Polen ist kein Manko, den Polen und Tschechien exportieren die meisten Karpfen. Da sollte man meinen, die beschäftigen sich dann auch intensiv mit der Zucht.\n",
      "Nein, es gibt ein anderes Kriterium : je kommerzieller ein Hersteller von Futter ist, desto mehr muß ich um die Qualität bangen. Wenn ich lese , dass ein Schweizer Lebensmittelkonzern Koifutter herstellt, weiß ich wie und wo er seine Abfälle entsorgt. Und wenn im Süddeutschen Raum ein Yokurthersteller als Futtermittelhersteller auftaucht, gilt sicher das Gleiche.\n",
      "Nein, gute Lebensmittel verlangen gute Zutaten, und gutes Futter verlangt ebenso gute Zutaten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wenn dann auf dem Label x-Zusätze aufgeführt sind hat man entweder ausgelaugte Zutaten oder Abfälle aus der Lebensmittelproduktion\n",
      "versucht wieder zum Leben zu erwecken.\n",
      "Und wer hauptsächlich Hunde und Katzenfutter herstellt, hat gar nicht die Resourcen sich mit Zierfischfutter zu beschäftigen, das läuft schlicht und einfach nebenbei.\n",
      "\n",
      "Und wenn irgendwo dann BHT und Konsorten steht, und drüber der Unsinn mit Superfood, dann kommt mir das so vor, als wenn ich mein Gulasch aus halb vergammeltem Fleisch mit einem Schuß Maggi kurieren könnte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bleiben Sie kritisch und löchern Sie im Zweifel den Hersteller. Muß er sich nicht schämen, wird er gerne Auskunft geben, denn er ist ja\n",
      "stolz auf sein \"Baby\", oder sollte es zumindest sein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ich habe mich schon mal zu dem Unsinn von Farbstoffen und Zusätzen geäußert und dieser Artikel soll das ergänzen.\n",

      "Hallo ,\n",
      "\n",
      "Als erstes wünsche wir Ihnen und Ihrer Familie ein ruhiges gesegnetes Weihnachtsfest und einen guten Rutsch in erfolgreiches 2018.\n",
      "Gleichzeitig bedanke wir uns für die gute Zusammenarbeit in 2017 .\n",
      "\n",
      "Was gibt es Neues, was steht 2018 an :\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir konnten seit 2014 die Preise stabil halten, zum Teil sogar senken. Dies hat nicht zuletzt die gute Zusammenarbeit und die Mengenzunahme ermöglicht. Hierdurch konnten wir verschiedene Rationalisierungsmöglichkeiten beim Einkauf und bei der Herstellung nutzen.\n",
      "In letzter Zeit aber sind die verschiedenen Kostenfaktoren derart gestiegen, dass wir 2018 um eine Preiserhöhung nicht rum kommen werden.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vorallem auf Grund der gestiegenen Rohstoffe und des starken Anstiegs bei den Verpackungskosten sind wir bei Chikara gezwungen die Preise anzuheben. Bei den Papiersäcken hat eine Steigerung von 23 auf 72 Cent stattgefunden .\n",
      "Wir nehmen das zum Anlaß um im Shop ab 2018 bei den 5 kg Beuteln komplett auf Alubeutel umsteigen. Wir sehen hier nicht nur den optischen Vorteil, sondern auch nahezu sauerstoffdichter Verschluß und damit bessere Haltbarkeit und bessere Erhaltung der Nährstoffe und Vitamine des Futters. Auch ist diese Art der Verpackung besser wieder verschließbar.\n",
      "Daneben wird es einen 7 kg Beutel geben. Dies ermöglicht eine bessere Ausnutzung beim Versand , denn statt bisher 25 kg ist dann in der Preisklasse bis 31,5 kg ein Versand von 28 kg\n",
      "zu gleichen Preis machbar.\n",
      "Einen Teil der Preiserhöhung konnten wir durch Veträge mit Versendern auffangen. Wir können dann 2018 einen Pauschalpreis für jede Versandklasse anbieten , der günstiger ist wie der bisherige Versand übder Hermes und DHL.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dem einen oder anderen mag aufgefallen sein, dass derzeit im Shop nicht sehr viel passiert. Wir platzen aus allen Nähten und arbeiten deshalb im Moment fieberhaft an einem neuen Shop. Der bisherige Shop - der beste von 1&1 übrigens - entspricht in vielen Bereichen nicht mehr unseren Anforderungen und Erwartungen. Da dieser Shop nicht auf einen anderen transferrierbar ist, sind wir gezwungen einen völlig neuen Shop zu entwickeln und alle Daten per Hand zu übertragen. Leider haben wir im Moment nicht die Kapazität parallel 2 e-Shops zu pflegen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gleichzeitig bauen wir unsere Lagerkapazität und die Versandstruktur um und aus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitte beachten : In der Zeit vom 28.12. 2017 bis 7.1.2018 erfolgt auch aus diesem Grund kein Versand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Grundsätzlich wurde 7 mm wegen der geringen Nachfrage aus dem Programm genommen , es wird die 7 mm aber von Zeit zu Zeit geben, wenn irgendwelche Sonderbestellungen anliegen. Wir werden dann rechtzeitig darauf hinweisen . Dier Preis wird sich allerdings dadurch erhöhen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Als neue Variante wird auf Anregung eines Kunden und dessen Tierarzt eine Variante Basic mit weniger Eiweiß ( geplant 30 % ) kommen. Damit sollen Teiche berücksichtigt werden, die einen Altbestand mit wenig zu erwartendem Wachstum haben.\n",
      "Da sie wenig oder gar nicht mehr wachsen dient die Eiweißreduktion der Verringerung der Kiemenbelastung. Möglicherweise ergibt sich hieraus auch ein Kostenvorteil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bitte beachten Sie bei den Preisen, dass Chikara auf Grund seiner Zutaten ein Hochleistungsfutter ist, das sowieso weniger gefuttert werden soll. So ist dann der Preis bei gleichem Wachstum , folgen Sie unserer Empfehlung mit 0,5 % des Körpergewichts , nur ein Viertel eines Futters mit der Empfehlung von 2 % .\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir werden auch im Shop die Preise nach Abschluß der Kalkulation entsprechend anheben\n",
      "\n",
      "Bei den Bezahlmöglichkeiten verhandeln wir gerade und hoffen Ihnen 2018 einen noch bequemeren Einkauf bieten zu können.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir danken Dir für die bisherige Zusammenarbeit und freuen uns auf eine weiter gute Zusammenarbeit 2018.\n",
      "Zwischenzeitlich wünschen wir nochmals einen ruhigen streßfreien Jahresausklang, ein frohes und gesundes Weihnachtsfest und einen guten Rutsch in ein erfolgreiches Jahr 2018.\n",

      "Hallo,\n",
      "\n",
      "vor etwa 10 Jahren begann ich mit einem Neubau des Teichs ( Gfk) und hatte dabei das Glück hier von Sakanaya-Hilble - den ich sehr schätze und dem ich ein funktionierendes System verdanke - entsprechend unterstützt zu werden.\n",
      "Das brachte es mit sich, dass der Teich weder symmetrisch noch eckig wurde. Wie richtig das war zeigte sich bei einer Revision nach 8 Jahren, bei der sich keine Gammelecken fanden. Soviel zur Vorgeschichte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diese Form wsar aber jedes Jahr vor den Wintermonaten eine Herausforderung.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zuerst habe ich es mit Bällen probiert und mich fast bankrott geheizt. Dann kamen Bälle + Folie, Auch nicht der Renner, denn die Schneelast hatte meist sehr schnell die Folie versenkt, die Steine zum Beschweren lagen danach im Teich.\n",
      "Also mußte ein Gestell mit Doppelstegplatten her.\n",
      "Erste Versuche fanden mit Holzlatten statt. Doch da im Winter von den Stegplatten durch die Heizung ständig das Wasser tropfte und es eher eine Feuchtkammer war, faulte entweder das Holz, oder bog sich massiv durch. Dadurch landeten die Platten wieder in der Nähe der Wasseroberfläche.\n",
      "\n",
      "Der nächste Versuch war WPC. Aber selbst diese starken Stangen bogen sich irreversibel. Von dem jährlichen Aufbauproblemen ganz zu schweigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eigentlich wollte ich in dem Jahr eine Terrasse überdachen, aber auf Grund von Vorarbeiten wird das wohl erst nächstes Jahr etwas. Ich hatte allerdings schon die Edelstahlstangen in der Garage. Wegen der Stabilität 40x40x2 mm. Am Teich gehen sicher auch 10x10 oder 20x20 mm, was im übrigen auch billiger sein dürfte.\n",
      "Ich hatte nun schon mal die Stangen und es sollte ja auch stabil werden.\n",
      "Nur wie kriegt man Edelstahlstangen teichnah um diesen rum ? Hier kam mir eine gute Auswahl an Steckfittichen zu Hilfe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diese sind auf dem ersten Bild zu sehen. Auf festem Untergrund gab´s Füße, im Beetbereich wurde die Stange einfach 10 cm in die Erde geschlagen. Somit ließ sich die Teichform in etwa nachbilden. Die Fittiche kann man kleben oder schrrauben . Natürlich verklebt man nicht alle , sondern bildet sinnvolle Umrandungsgruppen, die sich dann auch gut aufbewahren lassen. Diese werden an den vorgesehenen Teilungsstellen verschraubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nächstes Problem : wie die Syrodurplatten an den Edelstahstangebn befestigen . Durch Zufall sah ich im Baumarkt Blechteile aus dem Rigipsbereich. Ich wollte 30 er Platten + 40 Edelstahl also waren Bleche mit 70 mm ideal. Zugeschnitten , Aussparungen vorgenommen , und schwupp waren die Styrodurplatten perfekt fixiert. Zusätzlich entstand eine gleichförmige Auflagefläche.\n",
      "Nun bin ich kein geduldiger Mensch, der stundenlang an der Krümmung der Styrodurplatte für die Brücke schnitzt, also habe ich die Platten so genau wie möglich zugeschnitten. Die verbleibenden Ritzen und Spalten mit dem Filz - ebenfalls aus der Rigipsabteilung - zugeklebt. Der Filz ist deshalb ideal, da er auf einer Seite klebt und auf der anderen Seite mit einer Folie beschichtet ist.\n",
      "Danach alle Fehlstellen mit Bauschaum korrigiert. Durch die Filzauflage haftet der Bauschaum nicht an Terrassenplatten etc. sondern auf der Filzfolie. Danach die Doppelstegplatten angepasst, abgedichtet und mit einer Luftpolsterfolie das Ganze abgedeckt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Der hintere Teil des Teichs wurde noch mit Bällen aufgefüllt. Bei sehr strengen Wintern wird der ganze Teich mit Bällen noch ergänzt. Bei einer Platte wurde das Loch für den Futterautomaten ausgeschnitten , damit dieser auch im Winter zugänglich ist.\n",
      "\n",
      "So ist der Teich gut abgedichtet, und da ich ihn den ganzen Winter nicht unter 18 Grad sinken lasse ( Immunsystem ) hält sich der Energieaufwand in engen Grenzen ( bisher ca 1 Grad/Woche mußte nachgeheizt werden - Thermostatsteuerung die das ganze per Logo mit der Heizungssteuerung koppelt ).\n",
      "2 Kameras montiert über eine NAS ( Multimedie, Fa, Qnap ) angeschlossen, erlaubt ständige Kontrolle auch im tiefsten Winter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edelstahl läßt sich übrigens mit den Trennscheiben auf dem Bild superleicht trennen und läuft nicht einmal blau an.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vielleicht kann ich mit meinen Ideen den einen oder anderen zu Ähnlichem motivieren, oder per Bild dazu beitragen , das eine oder andere zu lösen.\n",
      "Das Edelstahlgestell ist übrigens so stark, dass ich mich drauflegen kann - balancieren muß ich erst noch üben , und wer mich kennt weiß, dass es dann wahrlich stabil ist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gruß Wolfgang\n",

      "Hier noch einige Bilder zum Text :\n",

      "Hallo,\n",
      "\n",
      "wollte ich meine Bemerkung, dass es beim Futter nicht nur auf die vom Computerprogramm entwickelte ideale Mischung - ich nenn es mal harte Fakten - , sondern auch auf Teichkomponenten - ich nenn die mal hier weiche Fakten, da sie sehr variabel sind - ankommt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ich lass jetzt mal alle weg die hier offensichtlich für irgenwen oder irgendwas Werbung machen (müssen) , sondern betrachten wir die unvoreingenommen ihr Hobby ernsthaft betreiben. Da muß es doch auffallen, dass zB. bei gleichem Futter zum Teil doch sehr gegensätzliche Erfahrungen geäußert werden. Das ist doch eigentlich verwunderlich, denn ein und dasselbe Futter sollte doch für alle entweder schlecht oder gut sein.\n",
      "Da sind meiner Meinung nach die weichen Faktoren die hier eine Rolle spielen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Was ich damit meine soll dieses Beispiel verdeutlichen :\n",
      "\n",
      "An meinem Teich - relativ kleines Volumen mit 25 qm aber massivem Überbesatz mit 42 Koi - hängt eine massive UVC mit 150 Watt, was in etwa 8o Watt UVC Leistung entspricht und eigentlich für 40 qm reichen würde. Zusätzlich habe ich noch einen Ozonkreislauf.\n",
      "Würde nun mein Futter das Wasser verfärben, könnte es gar nicht so schnell färben, wie Ozon und UVC das wieder zunichte machen.\n",
      "Wenn also jemand schreibt, dass das Futter xy das Waser verfärbt, könnte ich das nicht nachvollziehen . Da meine Teichsituation für mich selbstverständlich ist und ich testweise daran nichts ändern würde. Ich würde den anderen nicht verstehen, der andere mich nicht.\n",
      "Weiterhin fände ich in meinem Vliesfilter entsprechend viel Kot - ich filtere zum Teil zwischen 10 und 30 Mü - , während bei einem Trommler oder auch vorallem einem Spaltsieb der Kot zum Teil zerkleinert wird. Wieder kämen wir zu unterschiedlichen Ergebnissen. Jeder von uns Beiden würde sich über den anderen wundern.\n",
      "Auch eine dieser weichen Faktoren ist die Sauerstoffsättigung. Wenn jemand permanent einen Sauerstoffkonzentrator laufen läßt, womöglich noch mit über 100 % Sättigung, auch hier werden die Koi schlechteres Futter besser verdauen, als ein gutes Futter bei unzureichender Sauerstoffsättigung.\n",
      "Auch die Darmbesiedelung spielt eine Rolle. Im Darm des Koi besteht zum Teil eine Symbiose d.h. Bakterien zerlegen Nahrungsmittel und ziehen raus , was sie zum Leben brauchen, der Koi profitiert davon, dass das Futter in solche Teile zerlegt wurden, die er dann wiederum verdauen kann. Daher spielt die Zusammensetzung der Bakterien, sowie dessen Zahl auch eine Rolle. Neuere Forschungsergebnisse\n",
      "gehen davon aus , das es beim Menschen ebenso ist. So wäre auch zu erklären warum manche Menschen im Volksmund als bessere Futterverwerter gelten. Versuche, bei denen die komplette Darmflora vernichtet wurde und der Darm dann völlig neubesiedelt wurde konnten den Effekt nachweisen.\n",
      "Es ist also nicht so einfach ein Futter zu bewerten, wie es oft aus Sicht mancher Anwender mit \"Feuer und Schwert \" verteidigt wird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Es ist aber vorallem ein Trugschluß zu meinen ein Computerprogramm sei das Non plus Ultra. Es wäre nicht das einzige Mal, dass sich das was sich im Computer so vielversprechenden liest in der Praxis eher ein Flop ist.\n",
      "Nach meiner Ansicht zeigen das vorallem ein paar Firmen deutlich, die fast jedes Jahr eine neue Version vorstellen.\n",
      "Da bleibt dann schon die Frage : war das zuvor gepriesene Futter doch nicht so der Hammer ? Vorallem aber sind die Behauptungen des neuen Futters nur Behauptungen, denn es war bisher noch keine Zeit diese zu untermauern. Leider gibt es hier keine Vorschriften die valide Daten über einen gewissen Zeitraum verlangen, wie zB. in der Medizin.\n",
      "Und auch der Hinweis auf die Aquakultur finde ich immer gelungen, denn offensichtlich wird davon ausgegangen, dass ich entweder meinem Koi sehr schnell Pfunde anfüttern will, damit er einen guten Preis erzielt, oder damit er besonders schmackhaft wird.\n",
      "Ich für meine Person werde meine Koi weder nach Gewicht verkaufen, noch werde ich sie essen. Koi blau, nein danke .\n",
      "In meinen Augen sind Daten aus der Aquaristik eher zielführend , zwar mögen einzelne Daten Hinweise geben, diese müssen dann aber mit Bedacht angepasst und umgesetzt werden.\n",
      "\n",
      "So und jetzt gibts noch eine Handvoll Futter mit Knoblauch,Bärenklau zum Tee mit Stevia, denn warum soll es mir schlechter gehen wie meinen Koi.\n",

      "Hallo,\n",
      "\n",
      "was wird sich 2019 ändern :\n",
      "\n",
      "Premium und Color haben wir bereits auf 1 und 5 kg umgestellt, wir werden 2019 das ebenfalls bei den anderen Sorten sukzessive umstellen.\n",
      "Dieser Vorgang führt zu keiner Preiserhöhung, ermöglicht aber das Höchstgewicht der Pakete besser auszunutzen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apropos Preiserhöhung : Leider zeichnet sich am Weltmarkt ein eher düsteres Bild ab : Getreide wird auf Grund der Dürre im Sommer nicht nur ein kleineres Korn haben, sondern es wird auch weniger Ertrag geben. Damit zeichnet sich eine Preiserhöhung ab.\n",
      "Auch in anderen Bereichen vom Öl bis zur Paketgebühr drohen Preiserhöhungen. Auch der Staat zockt mit seiner neuen Verpackungsordnung kräftig mit. Die Gebühren für das Inverkehrbringen von Verpackungen haben sich fast verdreifacht.\n",
      "Wir hoffen trotzdem, dass wir in anderen Bereichen Einsparungen hinkriegen und die Preise halbwegs stabil halten können.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mit großer Sorge verfolgen wir den im Meer schwimmenden Plastikmüll . Hier ist es nur eine Frage der Zeit, bis es bei \"sauberen\" Rohstoffen ebenfalls zu entsprechenden Preiserhöhungen kommen wird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hier experimentieren wir im Moment und hoffen bald ein Futter präsentieren zu können, das bisherige Rohstoffe durch \"weniger riskante\" ersetzen soll. Dabei bleiben wir unserer Linie treu : Nach wie vor keine Industrieabfälle wie Federmehl, oder genmanipulierte Sachen wie Soja und Mais etc. zu verwenden .\n",
      "\n",
      "Wie bereits erwähnt konnten wir durch einen Glücksfall unser Lagerproblem über Jahre hinaus lösen. Bei Bedarf stehen uns bis zu 600 qm zur Verfügung. Und das in einem Lagerhaus, das über eine entsprechende Infrastruktur verfügt wie Laderampe, Waage für Schwerlasten usw. .\n",
      "Das es zuvor als Lagerraum auch für Getreide genutzt wurde, haben wir auch die Möglichkeit die Anforderung dunkel, kühl und trocken optimal zu gestalten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verpackungsmäßig werden wir im Laufe des Jahres komplett auf Verpackungen umstellen, die Frische und Aroma optimal bewahren, so wie Sie es zB. auch von Kaffeverpackungen gewöhnt sind. Die 1,5 kg bzw. 1 kg wird es dann nicht mehr in Plastik geben , sondern wir steigen damit um auf komplett recycelbare Verpackungen. Hierzu sind wir Mitglied von Landbell, so dass die entsprechenden Schritte gewährleistet sind . Unsere Verpackungen gehören also in den gelben Sack bzw. die gelbe Tonne.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auf der Homepage haben wir Fragen, Hinweise und Anleitungen überarbeitet und ergänzt. Hier kann der eine oder andere sicher wieder nützliche Hinweise finden.\n",
      "\n",

      "Hallo,\n",
      "Der Betriebsurlaub ist zu Ende und wir stehen frisch gestärkt für Sie bereit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aber nicht nur das, wir haben den Betriebsurlaub genutzt um einige Sachen umzustukturieren, was zu einem noch\n",
      "reibungsloserem Ablauf führen soll\n",
      "\n",
      "Aber vor allem waren wir mit der Produktion der neuen Charge beschäftigt, so dass wir nun wieder alle Sorten absolut frisch\n",
      "anbieten können.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gleichzeitig gab es einige Änderungen :\n",
      "Die Komposition der Öle wurde weiter optimiert. Die Zusammenarbeit mit der Ölmühle Garting im Chiemgau klappt hier hervorragend. Die Qualität ist erstklassig , wovon wir uns immer wieder durch Anwesenheit in der Mühle überzeugenkonnten. Öle spielen deshalb eine so große Rolle, da der Organismus sie zur Hormonbildung benötigt, und das nicht zuletzt für das Wachstumshormon. Zusätzlich ermöglicht uns die enge Zusammenarbeit zu gewährleisten, dass Chemie, die im Verdacht steht, Tumore hervorzurufen wie EHT etc. den Ölen nicht zugesetzt werden. Nach wie vor benutzen wir nur Toccotrienole und Rosmarinextrakt zur Konservierung. Für die optimale Wintervorbereitung bieten wir auch zusätzlich unsere Ölmischung zum Auffetten an. Der Feind solch hochwertiger Öle ist aber nicht nur der Sauerstoff, sondern auch Hitze, die im Nu aus einem mehrfach ungesättigten Öl ein gesättigtes machen und damit die biologische Wertigkeit nahezu ganz herabsetzen.\n",
      "Aus diesem Grund sprühen wir unsere hochwertigen Öle am Ende des Herstellungsvorganges auf, um eine thermische\n",
      "Belastung über 40 Grad zu vermeiden. Das führt mitunter zu einem leichten Ölfilm bei der Fütterung, ist aber die einzige\n",
      "Möglichkeit das Öl nicht zu ruinieren. Wir bemühen uns aber durch spezielle Lagerungsverfahren dies zu minimieren.\n",
      "\n",
      "Immun wurde weiter optimiert und nach den neuen wissenschaftlichen Erkenntnissen verändert. So wurde der Zinkanteil angehoben,\n",
      "da Zink in Enzymen bei der Immunabwehr eine wichtige Rolle spielt. Auch wurde ein zusätzliches Probiotikum und Knoblauch\n",
      "zugesetzt. Gerade jetzt im Herbst empfiehlt es sich, das Immunsystem vor dem Winter anzukurbeln.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unser Basic+ dient zusätzlich dazu, dass der Koi Energiereserven bilden kann , und so den Winter gut übersteht.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir haben auch zwischenzeitlich in Versuchen festgestellt , dass bei gleichem Futter, große Pellets zu mehr Ausscheidungen\n",
      "führen. Auch bei unserem optimierten Futter. Wir werden deshalb langfristig Basic 7mm auslaufen lassen und danach nicht mehr\n",
      "produzieren. Wir meinen,dass der Größenunterschied 5mm/7mm nicht so gravierend ist, aber schon 5 mm erzeugt deutlich weniger\n",
      "Ausscheidungen. Daneben hat ein kleineres Futter - wie wir immer schon propagieren - den Vorteil, dass es auf mehrere\n",
      "Porionen aufgeiteilt werden kann und damit ein kontinuierlicheres und damit artgerechteres Füttern erreicht wird.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beachten Sie auch unsere Sparte \"Wintervorbereitung und Herbstbundless\", die wir in den nächsten Tagen ergänzen und optimieren.\n",

      "Hallo,\n",
      "\n",
      "Immer wieder kommen Fragen zur Futtergröße, deshalb hier mal ein paar grundlegende Erläuterungen:\n",
      "\n",
      "Bei Chikara handelt es sich um ein Futterkonzept , das heißt nahezu allen Futtersorten liegen die gleichen Futterzutaten zugrunde. Eine Ausnahme bildet hier nur Premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "Warum ist das so ? Jede Futterumstellung ist für den Koi ein Streß und vor allem es dauert eine gewisse Zeit, bis der Fisch seine Bakterienbesiedelung im Darm entsprechend angepasst hat. Würde man nun kurzfristig eine andere Futtersorte füttern, wäre das für den Fisch nicht nur ein Streß,sondern die Zeit für die Darmanpassung wäre unter Umständen zu kurz, was zu einer schlechteren Futternutzung führt.\n",
      "Aus diesem Grund hat Chikara eine Art Grundmischung, die im Wesentlichen gleich ist. Diese wird nun modifiziert , das heißt Color zB. ist Basic plus mehr Farbpigmente, Immun ist Basic plus Immunstimulantien usw. .\n",
      "\n",
      "Was hat das mit der Größe zu tun ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Ganz einfach, wenn ich Zutaten habe wie Fischmehl, Getreide , Öl etc. so schwimmen diese Zutaten grundsätzlich. Jetzt gibt es zwei Möglichkeiten : Ich ändere das Rezept um Sinkfutter zu produzieren. Das vereinfacht die Sache wesentlich, Das ist aber auf Grund des Konzepts gerade nicht gewollt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also bleibt mir nur die physikalische Lösung : Ich muß das Pellet mit mehr Futtermischung \"vollpumpen\" und es stärker zusammenpressen, um bei mehr Gewicht eine kleinere Oberfläche zu erreichen. Das muß ich solang durchtesten bis das Futter sinkt. Der Pressdruck erhöht aber auch die Temperatur, also sind auch hier Grenzen gesetzt um nicht\n",
      "eine Maillardreaktion zu erzeugen. Diese drohrt ab ca. 140 Grad und produziert das bekannte Acrylamid. Aus diesem Grund ist es vorallem bei kleinen Futtersorten sehr sehr schwierig ohne Änderung der Rezeptur aus einem ansich schwimmenden Futter ein Sinkfutter zu machen. Eine unsere Vorsichtsmaßnahmen ist deshalb auch das nchträgliche Aufbringen des Öls um nicht zusätzlich noch aus ungesättigten Fettsäuren gesättigte zu Erzeugen.\n",
      "Deshalb weichen Schwimm- und Sinkfutter der gleichen Größe in Form un Größe voneinander ab.Schon deshalb haben wir die Maße als Circamaße bezeichnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dabei ist uns die Zusammensetzung und damit der Nutzen für die Koiernährung wichtiger, als kugelrunde Pellets zu produzieren die optisch was hermachen .\n",
      "\n",
      "Bei uns ist die Reihenfolge Ernährungswertigkeit , ob sinkend oder schwimmend und die Form und Farbe sind bei uns, da sie für die Qualität des Futters nicht maßgebend sind, eher von untergeordneter Rolle.\n",
      "BHT, ranziges Öl, Sojaabfall , Federmehl usw. aber schön rund und farbig, nein danke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wir hoffen , dass wir Ihnen die Problematik etwas näher bringen konnten und damit die Frage\n",
      "nach Größe und Form ausreichend erklärt werden konnte.\n",

      "This compost is the culmination of over a decade of fierce, relentless determination and dedication to creating remarkably fertile, potent, microbially diverse and abundant, energetically activated compost. It is an extraordinary feat, a labor of love, and a profound product of alchemy (that holds answers to some of the most critical issues humanity faces) in the truest sense of the word.\n",
      "\n",
      "A farm’s compost - its soil fertility factory - should be the centerpiece - the pride and joy - of the farm. It is the fuel for the engine. It is medicine that restores and elevates the life-sustaining, symbiotic capacity of the living skin of the earth so that soil, plant, animal and human populations can truly thrive.\n",
